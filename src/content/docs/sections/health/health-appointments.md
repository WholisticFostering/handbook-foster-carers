Children in care are entitled to high-quality, consistent healthcare.

As a foster carer, you play a key role in ensuring children:

- Attend health appointments.
- Receive preventative healthcare.
- Have their health needs reviewed regularly.
- Are supported to understand their own health.

Health needs should be actively promoted — not just responded to.

---

## 🏥 Initial Health Assessment (IHA)

When a child enters care, an Initial Health Assessment (IHA) should take place.

This assessment:

- Reviews physical health.
- Reviews emotional wellbeing.
- Identifies unmet health needs.
- Establishes a health plan.

You may be asked to:

- Provide observations.
- Share known medical history.
- Attend the appointment.

---

## 🔄 Review Health Assessments (RHA)

After the initial assessment, children must have regular Review Health Assessments:

- At least every 6 months for children under 5.
- At least annually for children over 5.

These reviews monitor:

- Growth and development.
- Immunisations.
- Dental care.
- Emotional wellbeing.
- Ongoing medical needs.

Attendance is essential.

## 🏫 Everyday Health Promotion

You are expected to promote:

- Balanced nutrition.
- Regular physical activity.
- Good sleep routines.
- Oral hygiene.
- Personal hygiene.
- Attendance at GP, dentist, and optician appointments.

Health promotion is part of everyday care.

---

## 🦷 Routine Appointments

Children should be:

- Registered with a GP.
- Registered with a dentist.
- Registered with an optician.

Dental checks are typically required every 6 months.

---

## 🧠 Emotional Wellbeing

Health reviews include emotional health.

You should monitor:

- Mood changes.
- Sleep patterns.
- Appetite changes.
- School engagement.
- Signs of anxiety or low mood.

Concerns should be reported to your Supervising Social Worker.

Early support prevents escalation.

---

## 💉 Immunisations

Immunisations should follow NHS guidance unless otherwise agreed.

Check consent arrangements before appointments.

Record all immunisations clearly.

---

## 📝 Recording Requirements

You must record:

- Appointment dates.
- Who attended.
- Outcomes or advice given.

Health information must be stored securely.

## 🤝 Working With Health Professionals

You may work with:

- GPs
- Paediatricians

- CAMHS
- School nurses
- Specialist services

Share relevant information appropriately and attend meetings where required.

---

## ⚠️ Escalating Health Concerns

If you are concerned about:

- Delayed treatment.
- Unmet health needs.
- Barriers to accessing services.

Raise this with:

1. Your Supervising Social Worker.
2. The child’s social worker.
3. Escalate if necessary.

Children in care should not experience delays in healthcare.

---

## 💛 Supporting the Child

Prepare children for appointments by:

- Explaining what will happen.
- Answering questions honestly.
- Offering reassurance.
- Avoiding dismissive language.

Medical environments can be anxiety-inducing, especially for children with trauma histories.
