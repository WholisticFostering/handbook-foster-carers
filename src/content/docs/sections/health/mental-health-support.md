Children in care are more likely to experience emotional and mental health difficulties due to trauma, loss, and instability.

Promoting emotional wellbeing is just as important as supporting physical health.

You play a vital role in recognising concerns early and providing consistent emotional support.

---

## 💛 Promoting Emotional Wellbeing

Everyday care should include:

- Predictable routines
- Warm, consistent relationships
- Open communication
- Emotional validation
- Safe boundaries
- Opportunities for play and relaxation

Feeling safe and valued supports emotional recovery.

---

## 🧠 Understanding Trauma

Many children in care have experienced:

- Abuse
- Neglect
- Domestic abuse
- Loss or separation
- Rejection
- Instability

Trauma may affect:

- Sleep
- Appetite
- Mood
- Concentration
- Behaviour
- Relationships

Challenging behaviour often reflects emotional distress rather than defiance.

## ⚠️ Signs of Emotional or Mental Health Concerns

Be alert to:

- Persistent sadness
- Withdrawal from activities
- Sudden behaviour changes
- Aggression beyond developmental expectations
- Self-harm
- Suicidal thoughts
- Risk-taking behaviour
- Sleep disturbance
- Eating difficulties

If concerned — record and report.

## 🚨 Self-Harm & Suicidal Thoughts

If a child:

- Talks about wanting to die
- Expresses hopelessness
- Engages in self-harm
- Has a plan to harm themselves

You must:

1. Take it seriously.
2. Stay calm and remain with the child.
3. Remove immediate risks if safe to do so.
4. Contact 999 if there is immediate danger.
5. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
6. Record clearly.

Never dismiss suicidal language as attention-seeking.

## 🏥 Accessing Support Services

Children may access support through:

- CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services)
- School counselling
- Therapeutic services
- Specialist trauma services

You may be asked to:

- Attend appointments.

- Support strategies at home.

Follow agreed therapeutic guidance consistently.

---

## 🗣 Supporting Conversations

Encourage children to:

- Talk about feelings.
- Name emotions.
- Ask for help.

Use calm, open-ended questions such as:

- “How were you feeling when that happened?”

Do not force disclosure.

---

## 🛌 Sleep & Routine

Emotional wellbeing is supported by:

- Consistent bedtimes.

Night-time anxiety may be common in children with trauma histories.

If concerns are ongoing or escalating:

- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Request professional support where appropriate.
- Escalate if you believe needs are not being addressed.

## 💛 Supporting Yourself

Supporting emotional wellbeing can be demanding.

Use:

- Supervision sessions
