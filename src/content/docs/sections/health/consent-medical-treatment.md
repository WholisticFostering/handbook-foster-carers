description: Guidelines for obtaining consent for medical treatment.
---

Children in care have the same right to healthcare as any other child.

However, consent for treatment can sometimes be more complex due to legal arrangements.

It is important that you understand:

- Who holds parental responsibility.
- What you are authorised to consent to.
- When to seek clarification.

If unsure — always check before consenting.

## 🧠 Who Can Give Consent?

Consent may be given by:

- A person with Parental Responsibility (PR)
- The Local Authority (where applicable)
- A young person deemed competent (Gillick competence)
- The Court (in certain circumstances)

You should refer to the Placement Plan for clarity about delegated authority.

---

## 📋 Delegated Authority

Delegated authority outlines what decisions you can make without seeking additional consent.

This may include:

- Routine medical appointments
- Emergency treatment
- Dental check-ups
- Optician appointments
- Minor illnesses

Delegated authority must be clearly recorded in the Placement Plan.

You must not exceed delegated authority.

## 🚨 Emergency Treatment

In an emergency:

- Call 999.
- Medical professionals can treat without prior consent if life-saving treatment is required.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.

The child’s safety always comes first.

---

## 🏥 Routine Medical Care

You are usually expected to:

- Ensure the child is registered with a GP.
- Register with a dentist and optician.
- Attend health appointments.
- Support immunisations (as agreed in care plan).

If consent is unclear for immunisations or planned treatment — seek clarification before proceeding.

## 🧒 Gillick Competence (Older Children)

Some young people may consent to their own medical treatment if assessed as competent.

This means they:

- Understand the treatment.
- Understand risks and benefits.
- Can weigh information appropriately.

Healthcare professionals assess competence.

You should inform your Supervising Social Worker if this situation arises.

## 💊 Prescriptions & Ongoing Treatment

Before agreeing to ongoing treatment:

- Ensure consent is authorised.
- Understand dosage and side effects.
- Inform relevant professionals.
- Update medication records.

Never agree to significant treatment without clarity on consent.

---

## 📝 Recording

You must record:

- Appointments attended.
- Treatment given.
- Who provided consent.
- Advice received.
- Follow-up arrangements.

Accurate recording protects everyone involved.

## 💛 Supporting the Child

Children may:

- Feel anxious about medical treatment.
- Be fearful due to past trauma.
- Have negative past healthcare experiences.

Provide reassurance, preparation, and calm support.

Do not dismiss fears.

---

## 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Children must receive appropriate healthcare.
- Consent must be lawfully obtained.
- Delegated authority must be clear.

Ofsted will expect to see:
