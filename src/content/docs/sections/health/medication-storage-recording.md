---

Foster carers share responsibility for promoting and protecting a child’s health.

Medication must be stored, administered, and recorded safely at all times.

Failure to follow correct procedures can place children at serious risk.

### 🧠 Key Principles

You must:

- Only administer medication that has been prescribed or authorised.
- Follow dosage instructions exactly.
- Store medication safely and securely.
- Record all medication given.
- Never share medication between children.

If unsure — seek medical advice before administering.

---

### 🔐 Safe Storage

Medication must be:

- Stored in a locked cupboard or container.
- Kept out of reach of children.
- Stored according to instructions (e.g., refrigerated if required).
- Clearly labelled with the child’s name.

Controlled medication must be stored securely and recorded carefully.

Check expiry dates regularly.

### 📋 Before Giving Medication

Always check:

1. The correct child.
2. The correct medication.
3. The correct dose.
4. The correct time.
5. The correct method (oral, topical, inhaled, etc.).

If the label is unclear or different from previous instructions — do not administer until clarified.

### 📝 Recording Medication

You must record:

- Name of medication.
- Dose given.
- Date and time administered.
- Your signature.
- Any missed doses (with reason).
- Any side effects observed.

Records must be accurate and completed immediately after administration.

Never pre-sign records.

### 🚫 Refusal of Medication

If a child refuses medication:

- Do not force it.
- Encourage calmly.
- Explain why it is important.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Seek medical advice if required.
- Record the refusal.

Some medications cannot be missed without risk — always seek advice if unsure.

### 💊 Over-the-Counter Medication

You must not give over-the-counter medication unless:

- It is permitted within agency policy.
- Consent has been obtained (where required).
- It is recorded.

Do not administer herbal remedies or alternative treatments without approval.

### 🚨 Medication Errors

If a medication error occurs (wrong dose, missed dose, incorrect timing):

1. Seek medical advice immediately (GP, pharmacist, NHS 111).
2. Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
3. Record the error clearly.
4. Complete an incident report if required.

Do not attempt to conceal mistakes.
