title: Tax & Qualifying Care Relief
---

Foster carers benefit from a specific tax scheme known as Qualifying Care Relief (QCR).

This scheme means that most foster carers pay little or no tax on fostering income.

It is your responsibility to understand your tax obligations and ensure you are registered correctly.

## 🧾 What Is Qualifying Care Relief?

Qualifying Care Relief is a UK tax scheme that:

- Provides a tax-free allowance for foster carers.
- Applies to approved foster carers.
- Covers fostering income and certain fees.
- Reduces or removes income tax liability in most cases.

The scheme is designed to recognise the unique nature of fostering.

## 📊 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

Qualifying Care Relief provides:

1. A fixed annual tax-free allowance.
2. An additional weekly tax-free amount per child placed.

If your total fostering income falls below this threshold:

- You will not pay income tax on fostering income.

If income exceeds the threshold:

- You may only pay tax on the excess.

Exact thresholds are set by HMRC and may change.

## 📝 Registering as Self-Employed

Foster carers must usually:

- Register as self-employed with HMRC.
- Complete an annual Self Assessment tax return.
- Keep basic records of income received.

Even if no tax is payable, a return may still be required.

Failure to register may result in penalties.

## 📂 Record Keeping for Tax

You should keep:

- Records of fostering payments received.
- Dates of placements.
- Any relevant correspondence.
- Copies of submitted tax returns.

You are not required to submit detailed receipts for everyday fostering costs under QCR.

Seek professional advice if you are unsure how income is treated.
