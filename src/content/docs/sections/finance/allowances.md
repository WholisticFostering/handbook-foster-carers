title: Fostering Allowances
---

Fostering allowances are provided to ensure that children in care have their needs met fully and appropriately.

Allowances are intended to cover the day-to-day costs of caring for a child.

They are not a wage for the child — they are for the child’s welfare and development.

---

## 🧾 What the Allowance Covers

The fostering allowance is intended to contribute towards:

- Food and household utilities
- Clothing and footwear
- School equipment
- Personal toiletries
- Transport (day-to-day)
- Activities and hobbies
- Birthday and seasonal celebrations
- Pocket money (as agreed)
- Basic replacement of personal items

Children should not feel financially disadvantaged in comparison to their peers.

## 📊 Payment Arrangements

Allowances are usually:

- Paid weekly (or as agreed).
- Paid directly into your nominated bank account.

Professional integrity is expected.
