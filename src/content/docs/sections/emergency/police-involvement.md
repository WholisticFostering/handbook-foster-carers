---

There may be occasions where the police become involved in matters relating to a child in your care or your household.

This can feel worrying, but clear procedures help ensure everyone’s safety and rights are protected.

Your role is to remain calm, cooperate appropriately, inform the agency, and record accurately.

---

### 🚨 When Might Police Be Involved?

Police involvement may occur due to:

- A child going missing.
- Allegations of harm or abuse.
- Criminal behaviour involving the child.
- Domestic incidents.
- Immediate safeguarding concerns.
- Risk of exploitation.
- Serious incidents in the community.

Not all police involvement means a child has done something wrong. Often, it relates to safeguarding.

### ⚡ Immediate Actions

If police attend your home:

1. Remain calm and cooperative.
2. Ask for:
   - Officer name
   - Collar number
   - Police station
   - Incident reference number
3. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
4. If outside office hours, contact the Out-of-Hours service.

Do not delay informing the agency.

### 🧒 If the Police Wish to Speak to the Child

Children in care have legal rights.

If police wish to interview a child:

- Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
- A social worker should be notified.
- An Appropriate Adult must be present.
- The child has the right to legal representation.

You should not act as the Appropriate Adult unless specifically agreed and appropriate.

---

### 🚫 If the Child Is Arrested

If a child is arrested:

- Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
- Provide relevant medical or vulnerability information.
- Ensure the child has access to an Appropriate Adult.
- Record all details.

Children in care are considered vulnerable and must be treated accordingly.

---

### 🛑 Use of Police to Manage Behaviour

Police should **not** be used to manage routine behaviour issues.

Police involvement should be a last resort and only where:

- There is immediate risk of harm.
- A criminal offence has occurred.
- Serious property damage has taken place.

Normal behavioural challenges should be managed through restorative and trauma-informed approaches.

---

### 📝 Recording Requirements

You must record:

- Date and time of police attendance.
- Reason for involvement.
- Officer details and reference number.
- What was discussed or agreed.
- Child’s presentation and response.
- Communication with the agency.

Records must be factual and completed promptly.

---

### 💛 Supporting the Child Afterwards

Police involvement can be frightening or distressing.

After the incident:

- Offer reassurance.
- Maintain calm routines.
- Avoid shaming language.
- Support reflection in a restorative way.
- Update risk assessments if necessary.

---

### 🔒 Confidentiality

Do not discuss police involvement with:

- Other carers
- Friends or family
- Social media
- Unauthorised professionals

Information sharing must follow safeguarding and data protection guidance.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Foster carers must safeguard children.
- Significant events must be reported.
- Police involvement must be recorded and reviewed.

Ofsted will expect to see:

- Appropriate thresholds for police involvement.
- Clear recording.
- Evidence of supportive responses.
- Avoidance of criminalising normal childhood behaviour.
