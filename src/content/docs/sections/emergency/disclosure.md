Children and young people may choose to tell you something very important.  
How you respond in that moment matters.

Your role is to **listen, reassure, record, and report** — not to investigate.

---

### 🧘 Stay Calm

If a child begins to disclose abuse:

- Stay calm and attentive.
- Stop what you are doing and give them your full attention.
- Let them speak in their own words.
- Allow pauses and silence — do not rush them.

Children may test your reaction before continuing.

---

### 👂 Listen Carefully

You should:

- Listen without interrupting.
- Take what they say seriously.
- Accept what they are saying.
- Reassure them that they did the right thing by telling you.

You might say:

- *"I'm really glad you told me."*
- *"You’ve done the right thing."*
- *"It’s not your fault."*

---

### 🚫 What NOT To Do

Do not:

- Ask leading questions (e.g., “Did he hit you?”)
- Press for more details.
- Investigate.
- Express shock or anger.
- Make promises of confidentiality.
- Confront the alleged person.

Avoid saying:

- *"Why didn’t you tell someone sooner?"*
- *"Are you sure?"*
- *"I won’t tell anyone."*

You cannot promise to keep this secret — you have a duty to share concerns to keep them safe.

### 📝 Recording the Disclosure

As soon as possible, record:

- Date and time of disclosure.
- Where it took place.
- Who was present.
- Exactly what the child said (use their words).
- Your response.
- The child’s presentation (e.g., upset, calm, withdrawn).

Keep your recording:

- Factual.
- Clear.
- Free from assumptions.
- Signed and dated.

Do not delay recording.

---

### 📞 Reporting the Disclosure

Immediately inform:

- Your Supervising Social Worker (SSW), or
- The Out-of-Hours service (if outside working hours).

### 🔒 Confidentiality & Information Sharing

Information should only be shared with:

- The fostering service
- Children’s Social Care
- Police (where appropriate)

Do not discuss the matter with:

- Family members
- Friends
- Other carers
- The alleged person

Safeguarding information must be handled sensitively and securely.

---

### 💛 Supporting the Child Afterwards

After reporting:

- Maintain normal routines.
- Continue offering reassurance.
- Do not repeatedly question them.
- Follow guidance from professionals.

Children may feel anxious after disclosing. Your calm consistency is important.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under safeguarding legislation and the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011, foster carers have a duty to:

- Protect children from harm.
- Report concerns promptly.
- Work in partnership with safeguarding agencies.

Ofsted will expect to see:

- Clear, timely reporting.
- Accurate recording.
- Appropriate professional boundaries.
