A child going missing is always a safeguarding concern.

Children in care are particularly vulnerable, and you must respond promptly, calmly, and in line with procedure.

Your role is to **take immediate action, inform the correct people, and record clearly**.

### 🔎 What Does "Missing" Mean?

A child is considered **missing from home** if:

- Their whereabouts are unknown, and  
- You are concerned for their safety or wellbeing.

This may include:

- Leaving without permission.
- Failing to return at an agreed time.
- Leaving during the night.
- Not returning from school or contact.

You do not need to wait a set period of time before acting.

### ⚡ Immediate Actions

If a child is missing:

1. **Try to contact the child** (phone, text, social media if appropriate).
2. **Check the home and immediate surroundings.**
3. **Contact friends, known addresses, or usual locations** (if appropriate and safe).
4. Assess risk based on:
   - Age and vulnerability
   - Time of day
   - Weather conditions
   - Emotional state prior to leaving
   - Previous missing episodes
   - Risk of exploitation

If you are concerned about their safety at any point — contact the police immediately.
