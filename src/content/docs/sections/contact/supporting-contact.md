Maintaining relationships with birth family is often an important part of a child’s care plan.

Contact arrangements should always:

- Promote the child’s welfare.
- Reflect the Care Plan.
- Be clearly agreed and recorded.
- Be supported in a child-centred way.

Your role is to provide emotional support and ensure arrangements are followed safely.

## 🧠 Why Contact Matters

Contact may help a child to:

- Maintain family connections.
- Preserve identity.
- Reduce feelings of loss.
- Understand their history.
- Prepare for future permanence decisions.

However, contact can also trigger complex emotions.

Children may feel:

- Excited
- Anxious
- Angry
- Conflicted
- Withdrawn

All reactions are valid.

## 📋 Following the Contact Plan

Contact arrangements will be outlined in:

- The Care Plan
- The Placement Plan
- Court Orders (where applicable)

You must:

- Follow agreed arrangements.
- Not make changes without authorisation.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker if issues arise.

Do not negotiate contact changes directly with birth family.

## 🚗 Transporting to Contact

If you are responsible for transport:

- Arrive on time.
- Remain professional.
- Avoid discussing case matters.
- Record attendance and presentation afterwards.

If contact is supervised by others, follow instructions from supervising staff.

## 💛 Preparing the Child

Before contact:

- Remind the child of the date and time.
- Answer questions honestly (age-appropriate).
- Acknowledge feelings.
- Avoid expressing personal opinions.

Preparation reduces anxiety.

## 🧠 Supporting After Contact

After contact, children may:

- Appear unsettled.
- Display challenging behaviour.
- Become withdrawn.
- Express conflicting emotions.

You should:

- Offer reassurance.
- Maintain routine.
- Avoid criticism of birth family.
- Record the child’s presentation.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker of concerns.

Behaviour changes may reflect emotional processing.

## ⚠️ Managing Difficult Contact

If contact:

- Causes emotional harm.
- Involves inappropriate conversations.
- Breaches agreed boundaries.
- Raises safeguarding concerns.

You must:

1. Record concerns factually.
2. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
3. Do not challenge birth family directly during the session (unless immediate safety issue).

Safeguarding concerns must be escalated promptly.

## 🗣 Remaining Neutral

You should:

- Speak respectfully about birth family.
- Avoid negative comments.
- Avoid sharing confidential information.
- Support the child’s right to love their family.

Children should never feel caught in loyalty conflicts.

## 📱 Indirect & Digital Contact

Contact may also include:

- Phone calls
- Video calls
- Letters
- Social media (if agreed)

Digital contact must follow the agreed plan.

Monitor online contact where appropriate and risk assessed.

## 📝 Recording Contact

You must record:

- Date and time.
- Whether contact took place.
- Child’s presentation before and after.
- Any significant incidents.
- Who was present.

Clear recording supports care planning and court processes.
