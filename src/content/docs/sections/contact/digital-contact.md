title: Managing Digital & Social Media Contact
---
Digital communication is part of everyday life for most children and young people.

However, for children in care, online contact with birth family or others can present additional safeguarding risks.

All digital contact must follow the agreed Care Plan.

---

## 🧠 Why Digital Contact Needs Careful Management

Online contact may:

- Bypass agreed supervision arrangements.
- Create emotional pressure.
- Expose children to manipulation.
- Share confidential placement details.
- Increase risk of exploitation.
- Undermine placement stability.

Children may not fully understand the risks involved.

---

## 📋 Following the Contact Plan

Digital contact arrangements should be clearly outlined in:

- The Care Plan
- The Placement Plan
- Court Orders (where applicable)

You must:

- Follow agreed arrangements.
- Not allow additional contact without authorisation.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker if concerns arise.

Do not negotiate digital contact directly with birth family.

## 📱 Types of Digital Contact

Digital contact may include:

- Phone calls
- Video calls
- Text messages
- Social media messaging
- Gaming platform messaging
- Email
- Photo sharing

All forms of communication carry potential safeguarding considerations.

## ⚠️ Unplanned or Secret Contact

Children may:

- Create private accounts.
- Use hidden messaging apps.
- Share placement information online.
- Accept friend requests from unknown relatives.
- Be contacted by birth family unexpectedly.

If unplanned contact occurs:

1. Remain calm.
2. Do not shame the child.
3. Record what has happened.
4. Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
5. Review the Safer Care Plan if necessary.

Avoid confiscating devices without discussion unless there is immediate risk.

## 🔐 Protecting Confidential Information

Children should not share:

- Their placement address.
- School details.
- Photos identifying the home.
- Details of foster carers.
- Care status publicly.

You must not post images or identifying information about the child online.

Placement confidentiality protects safety.

## 💛 Supporting Emotional Impact

Online contact can:

- Trigger emotional distress.
- Lead to loyalty conflict.
- Increase anxiety.
- Disrupt routines.

After digital contact:

- Monitor emotional presentation.
- Offer reassurance.
- Maintain routine.
- Record any concerns.

Behaviour changes may reflect emotional processing.

## 🛡 Online Safety Measures

You should:

- Use parental controls where appropriate.
- Check privacy settings.
- Discuss safe online behaviour regularly.
- Encourage openness about online interactions.
- Keep devices in shared areas where possible (age appropriate).

Monitoring should be proportionate and risk assessed.

## 🚨 Safeguarding Concerns

If digital contact involves:

- Threats
- Coercion
- Grooming
- Inappropriate images
- Criminal activity
- Exploitation concerns

You must:

1. Preserve evidence (do not delete messages).
2. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
3. Contact police if immediate risk exists.
4. Record clearly and factually.

Do not investigate independently.

## 📝 Recording Digital Contact

You must record:

- Agreed arrangements.
- Incidents of unplanned contact.

Clear records support risk assessment and care planning.

Avoid overly restrictive approaches unless risk requires it.

Proportionate supervision builds trust.
