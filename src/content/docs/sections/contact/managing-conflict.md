Children in care often experience complex feelings about relationships.

They may feel loyalty to birth family while also forming attachments within your home.

These mixed emotions can lead to:

- Internal conflict
- Challenging behaviour
- Withdrawal
- Divided loyalties
- Guilt or confusion

Your role is to provide stability without increasing pressure or conflict.

---

## 🧠 Understanding Loyalty Conflicts

A child may:

- Feel disloyal enjoying time in your home.
- Fear upsetting birth family by bonding with you.
- Defend birth family even when harm occurred.
- Reject your care to protect their identity.
- Feel responsible for family breakdown.

These responses are common and rooted in attachment and trauma.

---

## 💛 Supporting Without Replacing

You are not replacing birth family.

You are providing:

- Safety
- Stability
- Nurture
- Support

Avoid statements such as:

- “We’re your real family now.”
- “You’re better off here.”

Instead, reinforce:

- “You can care about both families.”
- “It’s okay to miss them.”
- “Your feelings make sense.”

---

## 🗣 Talking About Birth Family

Speak respectfully and neutrally.

You should:

- Avoid criticism.
- Avoid discussing adult case details.
- Avoid expressing personal opinions.
- Support the child’s right to love their family.

Children should not feel caught between adults.

---

## ⚠️ Behaviour After Contact

After contact with birth family, children may:

- Become dysregulated.
- Display anger or defiance.
- Withdraw emotionally.
- Express sadness.

This behaviour may reflect emotional processing rather than defiance.

Respond with:

- Calm consistency.
- Emotional validation.
- Clear boundaries.
- Routine.

---

## 🧩 Conflict Between Relationships

Sometimes children may:

- Compare households.
- Repeat negative comments heard elsewhere.
- Express preference for one environment.
- Reject rules in your home.

Remain:

- Calm
- Professional
- Consistent

Do not enter into competition or criticism.

---

## 🤝 Supporting Healthy Attachments

Attachment to you does not mean rejection of birth family.

Children can:

- Hold multiple attachments.
- Love more than one family.
- Experience loyalty without conflict.

Encourage open conversation.

Reassure them that caring about you does not mean betraying others.

---

## 🧠 Recognising Emotional Overload

Signs of emotional overload may include:

- Increased anxiety
- Sleep disturbance
- Somatic complaints (headaches, stomach aches)
- Heightened conflict
- Risk-taking behaviour

If concerns escalate:

- Record observations.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Request additional support if needed.

---

## 📝 Recording & Professional Communication

You must record:

- Changes in behaviour linked to contact.
- Statements expressing loyalty conflict.
- Emotional presentation before and after visits.
- Concerns raised.

These records support care planning and review.

---

## 💛 Supporting Yourself

Loyalty conflicts can feel personal.

Remember:

- Rejection may not be about you.
- Behaviour often reflects internal distress.
- Supervision is a space to reflect.
- Professional boundaries protect everyone.

Consistency builds long-term trust.
