Every child in care must have a Personal Education Plan (PEP).

The PEP is a statutory document that forms part of the child’s Care Plan.

It ensures that education is:

- Monitored
- Supported
- Prioritised
- Properly funded

As a foster carer, your contribution is essential.

---

## 🧠 What Is a PEP?

A Personal Education Plan:

- Sets clear educational targets.
- Tracks academic progress.
- Identifies additional needs.
- Allocates Pupil Premium Plus funding.
- Reviews attendance and behaviour.
- Identifies emotional or pastoral support.

The PEP ensures that children in care do not fall behind.

---

## 📅 When Do PEP Meetings Happen?

PEP meetings should take place:

- Within 20 school days of entering care.
- At least once every school term.

You are expected to attend wherever possible.

If you cannot attend, you must provide input.

---

## 👥 Who Attends a PEP Meeting?

PEP meetings may include:

- Foster carer
- Social worker
- Designated Teacher for Looked After Children
- Virtual School representative
- The child or young person (where appropriate)
- Other relevant professionals

The meeting should focus on practical support and measurable targets.

---

## 💷 Pupil Premium Plus (PP+)

Children in care receive Pupil Premium Plus funding.

This funding may be used for:

- One-to-one tuition
- Educational resources
- Emotional support programmes
- Enrichment activities
- Specialist interventions

Funding decisions must be linked to clear educational targets.

You may be asked to support agreed interventions at home.

---

## 📝 Your Role in the PEP

You should:

- Provide insight into the child’s home learning.
- Share concerns about attendance or behaviour.
- Highlight strengths and achievements.
- Support agreed targets consistently.
- Record agreed actions.

Your observations are valuable.

---

## 🎯 Setting Effective Targets

Targets should be:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

Examples:

- Improve reading level by one stage within the term.
- Attend school 95% of the time.
- Complete homework independently twice per week.

Targets should focus on progress, not perfection.

---

## ⚠️ When Progress Is Limited

If the child is not making expected progress:

- Raise concerns promptly.
- Request additional support.
- Ensure barriers are identified.
- Escalate concerns if necessary.

Children in care should not experience drift in educational support.

---

## 🧩 Additional Needs & EHCP

If a child has:

- Special Educational Needs (SEN)
- An Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)

The PEP should reflect:

- Agreed support strategies.
- Specialist input.
- Adjustments within school.
- Review dates.

Consistency between home and school is key.

---

## 💛 Supporting the Child

PEP meetings should be child-centred.

Support the child by:

- Preparing them beforehand.
- Explaining the purpose in simple terms.
- Encouraging their voice.
- Avoiding overwhelming discussions.

Children should feel education is something done *with* them, not *to* them.

---

## 📊 Recording & Follow-Up

After the meeting:

- Record agreed actions.
- Monitor progress.
- Support implementation at home.
- Raise concerns if actions are not delivered.

PEP outcomes may be reviewed during supervision.

---

## 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Educational progress must be monitored.
- PEPs must be completed and reviewed.
- Pupil Premium must be used effectively.

Ofsted will look for:

- Carer attendance at PEP meetings.
- Evidence of active involvement.
- Clear educational progress.
- Effective use of Pupil Premium funding.
