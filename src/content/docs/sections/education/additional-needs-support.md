Some children in care will have Special Educational Needs (SEN).

Others may have emerging needs that require assessment.

As a foster carer, you play a key role in identifying, supporting, and advocating for appropriate educational provision.

---

## 🧠 What Are Special Educational Needs?

A child has SEN if they have a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional educational support.

Needs may relate to:

- Communication and interaction
- Cognition and learning
- Social, emotional and mental health
- Sensory or physical needs

Trauma can also impact learning and presentation.

---

## 📋 Graduated Approach (Assess, Plan, Do, Review)

Schools should follow a graduated approach:

1. Assess – Identify needs.
2. Plan – Agree support strategies.
3. Do – Implement support.
4. Review – Evaluate effectiveness.

You may be asked to provide observations about:

- Homework behaviour
- Emotional presentation
- Concentration
- Triggers

Your input helps shape effective support.

---

## 📄 Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)

Some children will have an EHCP.

An EHCP is a legal document that:

- Outlines identified needs.
- Specifies required support.
- Sets measurable outcomes.
- Must be reviewed annually.

You should:

- Attend annual review meetings.
- Share observations.
- Monitor whether provision is delivered.
- Raise concerns if support is not implemented.

---

## 🏫 Working With the SENCO

Each school has a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO).

Build a positive relationship with the SENCO.

Discuss:

- Support strategies.
- Adjustments.
- Interventions.
- Progress concerns.

Clear communication improves outcomes.

---

## ⚠️ Recognising Emerging Needs

Some children may not yet have formal diagnosis but show signs such as:

- Difficulty concentrating.
- Struggling with literacy or numeracy.
- Emotional outbursts in school.
- Sensory sensitivities.
- Social communication challenges.

If you suspect unmet needs:

- Record your observations.
- Raise concerns with the school.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Request assessment if appropriate.

Early identification prevents escalation.

---

## 💛 Trauma & SEN

Trauma symptoms can sometimes resemble SEN.

For example:

- Hypervigilance affecting focus.
- Emotional dysregulation.
- Difficulty trusting adults.
- Delayed developmental skills.

Ensure trauma-informed approaches are considered before labelling behaviour.

---

## 🎯 Monitoring Progress

You should monitor:

- Academic progress.
- Emotional wellbeing.
- Attendance.
- Behaviour incidents.
- School feedback.

Raise concerns promptly if progress stalls.

Children in care should not drift without intervention.

---

## 📝 Recording & Escalation

Record:

- Meetings attended.
- Support agreed.
- Concerns raised.
- Progress observed.

If support outlined in an EHCP is not delivered:

- Raise this with the school.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Escalate if necessary.

EHCP provision is legally enforceable.

---

## 🤝 Supporting the Child

Children with additional needs may:

- Feel frustrated.
- Feel different from peers.
- Experience low confidence.

Offer:

- Encouragement.
- Realistic expectations.
- Celebration of strengths.
- Advocacy where needed.

Strength-based approaches improve resilience.

---

## 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Educational needs must be met.
- Children in care must receive appropriate support.
- Carers must advocate for provision.

Ofsted will look for:

- Evidence of carer involvement.
- Active advocacy.
- Delivery of EHCP provision.
- Improved outcomes over time.
