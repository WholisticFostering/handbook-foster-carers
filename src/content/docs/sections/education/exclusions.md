School exclusions should be rare for children in care.

Exclusion can significantly impact:

- Educational progress
- Emotional wellbeing
- Placement stability
- Long-term outcomes

If an exclusion occurs, it must be addressed quickly and proactively.

---

## 🧠 Types of Exclusion

There are two main types:

- Suspension (fixed-term exclusion)
- Permanent exclusion

Both must be reported immediately to the fostering service.

---

## ⚡ Immediate Actions If a Child Is Excluded

If informed of an exclusion:

1. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
2. Inform the child’s social worker.
3. Request written confirmation from the school.
4. Ensure the child is supervised during school hours.
5. Record the incident clearly.

Do not delay informing the agency.

---

## 📝 Understanding the Reason

You should:

- Ask for a clear explanation from the school.
- Request details of the incident.
- Clarify the length of the exclusion.
- Ask what steps are being taken to support reintegration.

Remain calm and professional in discussions.

---

## 🏫 Reintegration Meetings

A reintegration meeting should take place following a suspension.

You should:

- Attend where possible.
- Share relevant context (if appropriate).
- Discuss strategies to prevent recurrence.
- Ensure a support plan is in place.

The focus should be on support, not blame.

---

## ⚖️ Permanent Exclusion

Permanent exclusion should be a last resort.

If this is proposed:

- Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.
- Inform the child’s social worker.
- Seek advice and support from the Virtual School.
- Ensure the child’s voice is heard.

Alternative education arrangements must be made quickly.

## 🧩 Underlying Causes

Exclusions may relate to:

- Trauma triggers
- Attachment difficulties
- Special educational needs
- Emotional dysregulation
- Bullying
- Unmet learning needs

Addressing the root cause is essential.

---

## 🤝 Working With the School

Build constructive relationships with:

- Designated Teacher for Looked After Children
- SENCO
- Headteacher
- Pastoral staff

Discuss:

- Reasonable adjustments
- Behaviour support plans
- Additional learning support
- Risk assessments (if required)

Children in care should receive proactive support.

---

## 💛 Supporting the Child

After an exclusion:

- Remain calm and supportive.
- Avoid shaming language.
- Help them reflect on what happened.
- Focus on repairing relationships.
- Reinforce that education remains important.

Exclusion can feel rejecting or humiliating.

Your reassurance matters.

---

## 📚 Educational Provision During Exclusion

During suspension:

- Work provided by the school should be completed.
- The child must be supervised during school hours.
- Encourage structured daytime routine.

Extended periods without education must be escalated.

---

## 📝 Recording & Escalation

You must record:

- Date and type of exclusion.
- Reason given.
- Length of exclusion.
- Who was informed.
- Reintegration plans.

If exclusions become repeated or support is inadequate:

- Raise concerns with your Supervising Social Worker.
- Escalate if necessary.

---

## 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Education must be actively promoted.
- Children in care should not be disproportionately excluded.
- Additional support must be provided where needed.

Ofsted will look for:

- Low exclusion rates.
- Evidence of carer involvement.
- Appropriate challenge to schools.
- Clear reintegration planning.
