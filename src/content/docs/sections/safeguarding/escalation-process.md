title: Escalation Process

  order: 3
---

Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility.

If you raise a concern and feel it has not been appropriately addressed, you have a duty to escalate it.

Escalation is not criticism — it is about ensuring children are safe.

---

### 🛡 When Should You Escalate?

You should consider escalation if:

- You have reported a safeguarding concern and received no response.
- You believe the response does not adequately protect the child.
- There are repeated incidents without effective action.
- You feel professional disagreement is impacting safety.
- A child remains at risk despite previous reporting.

If in doubt — seek clarification first, then escalate if necessary.

---

### 🪜 Step 1: Speak to Your Supervising Social Worker (SSW)

In most cases:

- Contact your SSW.
- Clearly explain your concern.
- Provide factual information.
- Ask what action will be taken.
- Record the discussion.

Many issues are resolved at this level.

---

### 🧭 Step 2: Contact the Team Manager

If:

- You cannot reach your SSW.
- You believe the response is insufficient.
- The matter is urgent.

Contact the Team Manager or Senior Manager.

Provide:

- Details of the original concern.
- When it was reported.
- What response you received.
- Why you remain concerned.

Record this communication.

---

### 📢 Step 3: Use the Whistleblowing Procedure

If internal escalation does not resolve the issue, or if:

- You believe there is unsafe practice.
- There is misconduct.
- There is systemic failure.
- You feel unable to raise concerns through normal channels.

You may use the agency’s Whistleblowing Procedure.

Whistleblowing protects staff and carers who raise concerns in good faith.

---

### 🚨 Immediate Risk

If a child is at immediate risk of harm:

- Call 999.
- Inform Children’s Social Care directly if necessary.
- Then inform your fostering service.

Child safety must always come first.

---

### 🤝 Professional Disagreement

Sometimes professionals disagree.

If this occurs:

- Remain calm and professional.
- Focus on the child’s welfare.
- Use evidence and factual information.
- Request that concerns are formally reviewed.

Professional challenge is part of safeguarding.

---

### 📝 Recording Escalation

You must record:

- The original concern.
- Who you reported it to.
- Dates and times.
- Responses received.
- Further actions taken.
- Any follow-up outcomes.

Clear recording demonstrates responsible practice.

---

### 💛 Your Protection

You will not be penalised for raising safeguarding concerns in good faith.

You are fulfilling your legal and professional responsibilities.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Foster carers must safeguard children.
- Concerns must be acted upon appropriately.
- Services must respond to professional challenge.

Ofsted expects to see:

- Clear reporting pathways.
- Evidence of escalation where necessary.
- A culture of safeguarding and transparency.
