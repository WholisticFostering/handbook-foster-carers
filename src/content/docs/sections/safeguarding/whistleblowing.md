Whistleblowing is the process of raising concerns about unsafe, illegal, or unethical practice.

As a foster carer, you have a duty to speak up if you believe:

- A child is not being safeguarded.
- There is unsafe professional practice.
- There is misconduct or wrongdoing.
- Policies or procedures are not being followed.
- There is a risk of harm being ignored.

Raising concerns in good faith protects children — and you are protected when doing so.

---

### 🛡 When Should You Whistleblow?

Whistleblowing may be appropriate if:

- Safeguarding concerns have not been acted upon.
- You believe a colleague or professional has behaved inappropriately.
- There is systemic failure within the service.
- You feel unable to raise concerns through normal supervision channels.
- You fear victimisation for raising concerns.

Whistleblowing is not about personal grievances — it is about protecting children and ensuring safe practice.

### 🪜 Step 1: Raise the Concern Internally

Where possible:

1. Speak to your Supervising Social Worker.
2. Escalate to the Team Manager if necessary.
3. Contact a Senior Manager if concerns remain unresolved.

Be clear, factual, and focused on child welfare.

Record your concerns and who you have informed.

---

### 📬 Step 2: Use the Formal Whistleblowing Procedure

If internal routes do not resolve the concern, you may:

- Follow the agency’s Whistleblowing Policy.
- Submit a written concern outlining:
  - What happened
  - Who was involved
  - Dates and times
  - Why you are concerned
  - Any evidence available

Your identity will be handled sensitively and confidentially wherever possible.

---

### 🚨 External Reporting (If Necessary)

In rare circumstances, if concerns remain unresolved or are extremely serious, you may report concerns to:

- Ofsted
- The Local Authority
- The Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO)
- The Police (if criminal activity is suspected)

You should inform the agency unless doing so would increase risk.

### 🔐 Protection for Whistleblowers

You are protected under whistleblowing legislation if you raise concerns:

- In good faith
- With honest belief
- In the public interest

You must not suffer discrimination, victimisation, or disadvantage for raising safeguarding concerns.

---

### 🧾 Recording Concerns

Keep a clear record of:

- The issue raised
- Dates and times
- Who you informed
- Responses received
- Any follow-up actions

Maintain confidentiality and avoid discussing concerns informally.

---

### 💛 A Culture of Openness

A safe fostering service:

- Encourages professional challenge.
- Listens to concerns.
- Responds transparently.
- Puts children first.

Raising concerns is a professional responsibility — not disloyalty.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Services must have clear whistleblowing procedures.
- Foster carers must act to safeguard children.
- Concerns must be investigated appropriately.

Ofsted expects to see:

- A culture of openness.
- Evidence that concerns are taken seriously.
- Clear safeguarding accountability.
