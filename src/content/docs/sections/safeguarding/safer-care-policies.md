Safer Care is about creating a home environment that protects:

- The child
- You as foster carers
- Other household members

It supports safe, nurturing relationships while reducing risk and misunderstanding.

Safer Care arrangements should be clear, proportionate, and based on individual risk assessments.

---

### 🛡 What Is Safer Care?

Safer Care refers to agreed boundaries and practices that:

- Promote safeguarding
- Reduce the risk of allegations
- Support safe supervision
- Provide clarity about expectations

Safer Care plans are developed for each child and reviewed regularly.

---

### 🏠 Sleeping Arrangements

Children must:

- Have their own bedroom where possible.
- Not share a bedroom with an adult.
- Only share with another child where appropriate and risk assessed.

Bedroom doors should not normally be locked (except where part of a specific risk plan).

You should avoid entering a child’s bedroom unnecessarily and always knock first where appropriate.

---

### 🚿 Bathing & Personal Care

You should:

- Respect privacy at all times.
- Only provide personal care appropriate to the child’s age and needs.
- Record any assistance given to older children where relevant.
- Follow agreed plans for children with additional needs.

Never take photographs of a child in states of undress.

### 🤝 Physical Contact

Appropriate physical contact can be positive and reassuring.

However:

- Contact must always be appropriate to age and understanding.
- It must be initiated or welcomed by the child.
- It must never be secretive.
- It must never meet the adult’s needs.

Avoid:

- Rough play.
- Tickling.
- Sitting on laps (for older children).
- Physical restraint unless trained and absolutely necessary for safety.

### 🚗 Transporting Children

When transporting a child:

- Ensure appropriate car seats are used.
- Avoid transporting children alone without agreement (where possible).
- Do not allow children to sit in the front seat unless age-appropriate and safe.
- Inform the agency of any significant transport arrangements.

Never transport a child under the influence of alcohol or medication that impairs driving.

---

### 📱 Social Media & Digital Boundaries

You must:

- Not post photos of children in care on social media.
- Not identify children as being in foster care online.
- Maintain professional boundaries online.
- Avoid private messaging outside appropriate platforms.

Follow the Online Safety Policy at all times.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Supervision

Levels of supervision should reflect:

- Age
- Emotional maturity
- Known risks
- Missing history
- Exploitation risk

Children should not be left alone overnight unless formally agreed and age-appropriate.

Babysitting arrangements must follow agency guidance.

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Household Members & Visitors

Ensure:

- All household members understand boundaries.
- Visitors are appropriate and safe.
