Accurate recording is one of your most important professional responsibilities.

Good recording:

- Protects children.
- Protects you.
- Supports safeguarding investigations.
- Demonstrates compliance during inspection.

If in doubt — record and report.

---

### 🛡 Why Recording Matters

Your records may be used in:

- Safeguarding enquiries
- Strategy meetings
- Court proceedings
- Ofsted inspections
- Placement reviews

Records must be:

- Factual
- Clear
- Timely
- Professional

Poor or delayed recording can place children at risk.

---

### ⏰ Record Promptly

Record concerns:

- As soon as possible after the event.
- On the same day wherever possible.
- While details are fresh in your mind.

Do not wait until supervision to record safeguarding concerns.

---

### ✍️ What To Include

When recording a concern, include:

- Date and time of the incident or disclosure
- Date and time of your recording
- Who was present
- What was observed
- What was said (use the child’s exact words where possible)
- What action you took
- Who you informed and when
- The child’s presentation (e.g., upset, withdrawn, calm)

Be specific.

Instead of writing:

> "Child was upset."

Write:

> "Child was crying, avoided eye contact, and stated, 'I don’t feel safe going there.'"

---

### 🚫 What To Avoid

Do not:

- Include assumptions
- Speculate about motives
- Use emotive language
- Make diagnoses
- Blame or criticise

Avoid phrases such as:

- "He was lying."
- "She was being dramatic."
- "I think he made it up."

Stick to facts and observable behaviours.

---

### 🗣 Recording Disclosures

If a child discloses something:

- Record their exact words in quotation marks.
- Do not paraphrase important statements.
- Do not correct grammar or language.
- Do not add interpretation.

Example:

> Child stated, "He touched me and told me not to tell."

Your role is not to investigate — only to record and report.

---

### 📸 Injuries

If recording an injury:

- Note size, colour, shape, and location.
- Avoid drawing conclusions about how it occurred.
- Follow agency guidance regarding body maps or photographs.
- Report immediately if safeguarding concerns arise.

---

### 📤 Reporting After Recording

Recording does not replace reporting.

You must:

1. Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
2. Follow safeguarding procedures.
3. Complete any required incident forms.

Safeguarding concerns must be escalated — not just written down.

---

### 🔐 Confidentiality & Data Protection

Records must be:

- Stored securely.
- Shared only with authorised professionals.
- Written professionally (children may access records in the future).

Remember:

Children and young people have the right to access their records.

Write with this in mind.

---

### 📊 Daily Logs vs Safeguarding Records

Not all entries are safeguarding concerns.

Daily logs should include:

- Significant events
- Achievements
- Health matters
- Behaviour incidents

Safeguarding concerns must also be reported directly to the agency.

If unsure — treat it as a safeguarding concern.

---

### 🛑 Escalation If Concern Is Not Addressed

If you believe your concern has not been acted upon appropriately:

- Raise this with your Supervising Social Worker.
- Escalate to the Team Manager if necessary.
- Use the whistleblowing procedure if required.

You have a duty to advocate for the child.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Accurate records must be maintained.
- Significant events must be reported.
- Safeguarding concerns must be escalated.

Ofsted will look for:

- Timely entries
- Clear factual recording
- Evidence of appropriate reporting
- Professional tone
