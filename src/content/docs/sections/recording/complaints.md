title: Complaints Procedure
---

Everyone involved in fostering has the right to raise concerns or make a complaint.

This includes:

- Foster carers
- Children and young people
- Birth family members
- Other professionals

A clear complaints process promotes transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement.

Raising a complaint should never negatively impact a placement or professional relationship.

## 🧒 Complaints from Children & Young People

Children in care must:

- Be informed of their right to complain.
- Know how to access an advocate.
- Be supported to express concerns.
- Be taken seriously.

If a child wishes to make a complaint:

1. Listen calmly.
2. Do not dismiss or minimise concerns.
3. Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
4. Support the child to access advocacy if requested.
5. Record the concern factually.

Children must never be discouraged from complaining.

- Processes or procedures.

You should:

## 💛 Professional Conduct During Complaints

While a complaint is being investigated:

Accurate records support transparency and accountability.
