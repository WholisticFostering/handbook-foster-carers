title: Daily Logs & Record Keeping Standards
---

Accurate, timely recording is a core professional responsibility for foster carers.

Records:

- Protect children.
- Protect you.
- Inform care planning.
- Support safeguarding investigations.
- Provide evidence during inspection.

Children may access their records in the future — always write with this in mind.

## 🧠 Why Daily Logs Matter

Daily logs help:

- Track emotional wellbeing.
- Identify behavioural patterns.
- Monitor progress.
- Evidence positive outcomes.
- Inform supervision and reviews.
- Support court processes if required.

Recording is not optional — it is part of your professional role.

## ✍️ What Should Be Recorded?

Daily logs should include:

- Significant events.
- School attendance and feedback.
- Health appointments.
- Behaviour incidents.
- Emotional presentation.
- Achievements and milestones.
- Contact sessions (summary only).
- Safeguarding concerns (also reported separately).
- Visitors or significant changes.

Not every small detail is required — focus on what is relevant and meaningful.

## 📝 How to Record Effectively

Records must be:

- Factual.
- Clear.
- Objective.
- Professional.
- Written promptly (ideally same day).
- Signed and dated.

Use specific descriptions rather than general statements.

Instead of:

> "Child had a bad day."

Write:

> "Child returned from school at 3:30pm appearing withdrawn, did not engage in conversation, and declined dinner. Stated, 'I hate it there.'"

---

## 🚫 What Not To Include

Do not:

- Speculate.
- Diagnose.
- Use judgemental language.
- Include unnecessary adult opinions.
- Share confidential information about others.
- Record in anger.

Avoid phrases such as:

- “Attention-seeking”
- “Manipulative”
- “Lazy”
- “Liar”

Stick to observable behaviour and direct quotes.

---

## 🔒 Confidentiality & Data Protection

Records must be:

- Stored securely.
- Password protected (if digital).
- Not shared without authorisation.
- Not discussed informally.

Children and young people have a legal right to request access to their records.

Write respectfully and professionally.

## 📤 Reporting Significant Events

Recording does not replace reporting.

You must immediately report:

- Safeguarding concerns.
- Allegations.
- Missing episodes.
- Police involvement.
- Serious injury.
- Medication errors.
- Exclusions.

Then record the action taken.

Records demonstrate the standard of care provided.

## 🧾 Retention of Records

You must:

- Submit records as required by the agency.

Records form part of the child’s official file.

## 💛 Recording Positive Outcomes

Include:

- Achievements.
- Emotional progress.

Children benefit from seeing their strengths recorded.
