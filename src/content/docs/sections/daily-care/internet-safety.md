The internet is an important part of children’s education, social life, and identity.

However, children in care may be particularly vulnerable to online risks.

Your role is to promote safe, responsible, and age-appropriate online use — not to remove access unnecessarily.

---

### 🌐 Why Online Safety Matters

Online risks can include:

- Grooming
- Sexual exploitation
- Criminal exploitation
- Cyberbullying
- Radicalisation
- Sharing inappropriate images
- Online scams
- Exposure to harmful content

Children who go missing or who have experienced trauma may be at increased risk of online exploitation.

### 🛡 Creating a Safe Digital Environment

You should:

- Use parental controls appropriate to the child’s age.
- Keep devices in shared spaces where possible.
- Agree clear online rules.
- Monitor usage proportionately.
- Be aware of apps and platforms being used.

Restrictions should be balanced with trust and development.

---

### 📱 Social Media

Children may use platforms such as:

- Messaging apps
- Gaming platforms
- Social media networks

You should:

- Discuss privacy settings.
- Talk about not sharing personal information.
- Remind children not to share their location.
- Ensure they do not disclose their foster placement publicly.

Never post images or information about a child in care on your own social media.

---

### ⚠️ Sharing Images (Sexting)

Young people may:

- Share images impulsively.
- Feel pressured by peers.
- Not understand long-term consequences.

If you discover inappropriate image sharing:

1. Stay calm.
2. Do not shame the child.
3. Do not forward or store images.
4. Inform your Supervising Social Worker immediately.

This may require safeguarding intervention.

### 🎮 Online Gaming

Online gaming may involve:

- Chat functions with strangers.
- In-game purchases.
- Exposure to inappropriate language or content.

You should:

- Check age ratings.
- Disable open chat where appropriate.
- Monitor spending.
- Discuss online conduct and boundaries.

---

### 🚨 Signs of Online Risk

Be alert to:

- Secrecy about devices.
- Sudden new online “friends”.
- Receiving unexplained gifts or money.
- Increased missing episodes.
- Mood changes linked to device use.
- Reluctance to attend school.

If concerned, record and report immediately.

### 🤝 Talking About Online Safety

Open conversations are more effective than strict bans.

Discuss:

- Respect online.
- Consent and image sharing.
- Digital footprints.
- Reporting inappropriate content.
- What to do if something feels uncomfortable.

Encourage children to tell you if something worries them online.

---

### ⚖️ Balance & Development

Children need to:

- Develop digital literacy.
- Learn responsible online behaviour.
- Build independence safely.

Overly restrictive approaches may increase secrecy.

Proportionate supervision builds trust.

---

### 📝 Recording & Reporting

If there are online safeguarding concerns:

- Record the details factually.
- Include dates, times, usernames if known.
- Inform your Supervising Social Worker.
- Follow safeguarding procedures.

Do not investigate independently.
