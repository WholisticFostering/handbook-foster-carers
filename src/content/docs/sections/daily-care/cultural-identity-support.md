description: Supporting cultural and identity needs of children.
---

Every child has a right to understand, value, and feel proud of who they are.

Children in care may experience disruption to their identity through separation from family, culture, community, or faith.

As a foster carer, you play an important role in supporting and promoting a child’s identity.

---

### 🧠 What Do We Mean by Identity?

A child’s identity includes:

- Culture and ethnicity
- Religion or belief
- Language
- Family history
- Sexual orientation
- Disability
- Community connections
- Personal interests and talents

Identity is not just background information — it shapes how a child sees themselves and the world.

---

### 💛 Why Identity Matters

When identity is supported, children are more likely to:

- Develop positive self-esteem
- Feel secure and valued
- Build resilience
- Experience placement stability
- Achieve better emotional wellbeing

Ignoring or minimising identity can increase feelings of loss and isolation.

---

### 🌏 Supporting Cultural Heritage

You can promote cultural identity by:

- Learning about the child’s heritage.
- Providing culturally appropriate food.
- Supporting cultural celebrations and festivals.
- Encouraging links with community groups.
- Accessing books, media, and toys that reflect the child’s background.

Ask the child what is important to them.

Do not assume based on appearance.

---

### 🙏 Religion & Belief

Children have the right to practise their religion (where appropriate and safe).

Support may include:

- Attending places of worship.
- Observing religious holidays.
- Providing appropriate clothing or dietary requirements.
- Accessing religious education or materials.

Discuss arrangements with the child’s social worker where necessary.

---

### 🏳️‍🌈 Sexual Orientation

Young people may explore:

- Sexual orientation

You should:

- Provide a safe and non-judgemental environment.
- Challenge discriminatory language.
- Seek advice if unsure how to support appropriately.

Respect and dignity are essential.

---

### 🧩 Disability & Additional Needs

Identity also includes:

- Neurodiversity
- Physical disabilities
- Learning differences

Promote:

- Inclusive language.
- Access to appropriate services.
- Celebration of strengths.
- Advocacy where needed.

---

### 🧬 Life Story & Family History

Children in care may struggle with gaps in their personal history.

You can support identity by:

- Supporting life story work.
- Keeping memory books.
- Preserving photos and important items.
- Talking positively (and neutrally) about birth family.

Children should never feel ashamed of their background.

---

### 🏠 Belonging in Your Home

Promote belonging by:

- Including the child in family routines.
- Displaying appropriate photos.
- Celebrating achievements.
- Ensuring their space reflects their personality.

Belonging does not replace their birth identity — it supports emotional security.

---

### 🚫 Challenging Discrimination

If a child experiences discrimination:

- Take it seriously.
- Offer reassurance.
- Report safeguarding concerns where relevant.
- Challenge prejudice appropriately.
- Work with schools and professionals.

Children in care may already feel different — avoid increasing that sense of isolation.

---

### 📝 Recording & Care Planning

Identity needs should be reflected in:

- Care Plans
- Placement Plans
- Personal Education Plans (PEPs)
- Safer Care Plans (where relevant)

Record how you are promoting identity in daily logs.

Ofsted may ask children how their identity is supported.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Children must be treated with dignity and respect.
- Cultural and religious needs must be met.
- Diversity must be promoted.

Ofsted will look for:

- Active promotion of identity.
- Evidence of inclusion.
- Children feeling valued and respected.
