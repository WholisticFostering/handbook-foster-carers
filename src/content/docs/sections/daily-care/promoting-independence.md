One of the key goals of fostering is to prepare children and young people for adulthood.

Promoting independence is about gradually developing:

- Confidence
- Life skills
- Decision-making ability
- Responsibility
- Emotional resilience

Independence should always be age-appropriate and based on individual needs.

### 🧠 Why Independence Matters

Children in care may have:

- Missed opportunities to learn practical skills.
- Experienced over-dependence or over-independence.
- Had inconsistent guidance.
- Lacked positive role modelling.

Developing independence supports:

- Self-esteem
- Education and employment outcomes
- Safer transitions to adulthood
- Emotional wellbeing

---

### 🏠 Everyday Life Skills

Encourage involvement in daily routines such as:

- Cooking and meal preparation
- Laundry
- Cleaning their room
- Shopping and budgeting
- Managing personal hygiene
- Time management

Start small and build gradually.

Praise effort as well as achievement.

### 💷 Financial Skills

Support young people to learn:

- Budgeting pocket money
- Understanding bank accounts
- Saving
- Recognising scams
- Making informed purchases

Financial independence reduces vulnerability to exploitation.

---

### 🗣 Decision-Making

Encourage children to:

- Express preferences.
- Participate in house rules.
- Contribute to planning.
- Make safe, supported choices.

Learning from minor mistakes builds resilience.

---

### 🚶 Safe Independence

Independence may include:

- Walking to school.
- Visiting friends.
- Using public transport.
- Staying home alone (where appropriate).

Any independence must:

- Be risk assessed.
- Be age-appropriate.
- Be agreed in the Placement Plan where required.

Children should not be left alone overnight unless formally agreed.

### 🎓 Preparing for Adulthood (Older Young People)

Older young people may need support with:

- College or apprenticeship applications
- CV writing
- Job interviews
- Renting accommodation
- Understanding tenancy agreements
- Registering with utilities
- Accessing benefits (where applicable)

Work collaboratively with Personal Advisers and Leaving Care services.

---

### 💛 Emotional Independence

Independence is not just practical — it is emotional.

Support young people to:

- Manage disappointment.
- Resolve conflicts.
- Ask for help when needed.
- Regulate emotions safely.

Balance support with gradual responsibility.

---

### ⚠️ Avoiding Sudden Independence

Do not:

- Expect adult-level responsibility too early.
- Withdraw support abruptly.
- Link independence solely to age.

Some children may have experienced “parentification” (taking on adult roles too early).

Independence must be supported, not forced.

---

### 📝 Recording Progress

Record in daily logs:

- New skills learned.
- Responsibilities taken on.
- Positive achievements.
- Areas needing support.

Independence goals should be reflected in:

- Placement Plans
- Pathway Plans (for older young people)
- PEP meetings (where relevant)

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Foster carers must prepare children for adulthood.
- Children must be supported to develop life skills.
- Transitions must be planned and supported.

Ofsted will look for:
