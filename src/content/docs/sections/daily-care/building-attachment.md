description: Tips for building attachment with children.
---

Children in care may have experienced disrupted, inconsistent, or harmful early relationships.

Attachment is about helping a child feel:

- Safe
- Valued
- Understood
- Secure

Strong attachments support emotional regulation, behaviour, education, and long-term wellbeing.

---

### 🧠 Understanding Attachment

Attachment develops when a child experiences:

- Consistent care
- Predictable responses
- Emotional warmth
- Reliable protection

Children who have experienced trauma may:

- Push adults away
- Appear overly independent
- Be overly clingy
- Struggle with trust
- Test boundaries repeatedly

These behaviours often reflect fear of rejection or abandonment.

---

### 💛 Creating Emotional Safety

You can promote secure attachment by:

- Being consistent.
- Keeping routines predictable.
- Following through on promises.
- Remaining calm during conflict.
- Repairing relationships after disagreements.

Small, repeated experiences of safety build trust over time.

### 🗣 Listening & Validation

Children need to feel heard.

Try:

- “I can see that was really hard for you.”
- “It makes sense you felt upset.”
- “I’m here for you.”

Validation does not mean agreeing with behaviour — it means acknowledging feelings.

---

### 🔁 Repair After Conflict

All relationships experience conflict.

Attachment strengthens when:

- Adults apologise where appropriate.
- Conversations happen after emotions settle.
- The child knows the relationship is secure.

Avoid holding grudges or withdrawing emotionally.

Repair builds resilience.

### ⏳ Patience & Consistency

Attachment takes time.

Progress may look like:

- A child accepting comfort.
- Reduced emotional outbursts.
- Seeking help rather than isolating.
- Increased eye contact.
- Sharing thoughts or worries.

Trust develops through repeated positive interactions.

### 🎯 Responding to Attachment Difficulties

Some children may display:

- Avoidant behaviour
- Controlling behaviour
- Aggression
- Excessive independence
- Fear of closeness

Support strategies include:

- Clear boundaries
- Gentle reassurance
- Consistent routines
- Professional input (where needed)

Do not personalise rejection — it often reflects past experiences.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Supporting Identity & Belonging

Children build attachment when they feel they belong.

You can support this by:

- Displaying photos (if appropriate).
- Celebrating birthdays and achievements.
- Including the child in family routines.
- Respecting their cultural and family identity.

Belonging strengthens emotional security.

### 🏫 Attachment & School

Attachment difficulties may impact:

- Concentration
- Relationships with teachers
- Peer interactions
- Attendance

Work collaboratively with schools to support emotional regulation and consistency.

Secure adults help children feel secure.
