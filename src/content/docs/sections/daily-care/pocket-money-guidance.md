Pocket money is an important part of promoting independence, responsibility, and financial understanding.

It should be:

- Fair
- Age-appropriate
- Consistent
- In line with agency guidance

Pocket money must not be used as a reward for basic care or withheld as a punishment (except in clearly agreed and proportionate circumstances).

---

### 🧠 Why Pocket Money Matters

Providing regular pocket money helps children:

- Learn budgeting skills
- Develop responsibility
- Understand saving and spending
- Build independence
- Feel equal to peers

Children in care should not feel disadvantaged compared to their friends.

---

### 📊 Amounts & Frequency

Pocket money should follow:

- The agency’s agreed rates
- Age-based guidance
- Any specific Placement Plan arrangements

It should normally be paid:

- Weekly
- On an agreed day
- In a consistent way

Consistency builds trust and predictability.

### 💡 Teaching Financial Skills

Use pocket money as a learning opportunity:

- Help the child plan spending.
- Encourage saving for larger items.
- Discuss needs vs wants.
- Support opening a bank account (age appropriate).
- Introduce basic budgeting skills.

For older young people, consider:

- Digital banking awareness
- Online shopping safety
- Avoiding scams
- Responsible use of debit cards

---

### ⚖️ Sanctions & Deductions

Pocket money should not be:

- Stopped completely as punishment.
- Used to control behaviour.
- Withheld for minor issues.

If deductions are necessary (for example, deliberate damage to property):

- They must be proportionate.
- They must be explained clearly.
- They must be recorded.
- They must follow agency policy.

Basic allowances must not be removed in a way that undermines wellbeing.

### 🛍 Clothing & Personal Items

Pocket money is separate from:

- Clothing allowances
- School equipment
- Essential toiletries
- Birthday or festival gifts

Children should not be expected to use pocket money for essential needs.

---

### 🤝 Fairness & Equality

Children in the same household should receive:

- Fair treatment.
- Comparable arrangements (age appropriate).
- Clear explanations of any differences.

Transparency avoids feelings of unfairness.

---

### 📝 Recording

Record:

- The agreed pocket money arrangement.
- Any deductions (with reasons).
- Support provided around budgeting.
- Progress in financial skills.

This may be discussed during supervision or inspection.

---

### 💛 Promoting Dignity

Pocket money supports:

- Choice
- Confidence
- Peer inclusion
- Self-esteem

Handling money appropriately helps children feel trusted and respected.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Children must receive appropriate financial support.
- Financial arrangements must promote welfare.
- Sanctions must be proportionate and recorded.

Ofsted will look for:

- Fair and consistent practice.
