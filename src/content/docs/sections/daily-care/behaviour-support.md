Children in care often communicate their experiences, trauma, and unmet needs through behaviour.

Behaviour is a form of communication.

Your role is to respond with understanding, consistency, and clear boundaries — not punishment.

---

### 🧠 Understanding Behaviour

Many children in care have experienced:

- Trauma
- Neglect
- Loss
- Instability
- Rejection
- Abuse

This can affect:

- Emotional regulation
- Trust in adults
- Attachment patterns
- Impulse control

Challenging behaviour is often rooted in past experiences rather than deliberate defiance.

---

### 💛 Trauma-Informed Approach

A trauma-informed approach means:

- Looking beyond the behaviour.
- Asking, “What happened to you?” not “What’s wrong with you?”
- Recognising triggers.
- Providing safety and predictability.

Children need:

- Calm adults
- Consistent routines
- Clear expectations
- Repair after conflict

---

### 🧱 Clear Boundaries

Children feel safer when boundaries are:

- Clear
- Consistent
- Fair
- Explained in advance

You should:

- Set house rules collaboratively where appropriate.
- Explain consequences calmly.
- Follow through consistently.
- Avoid sudden or extreme reactions.

---

### 🚫 What Is Not Permitted

The following are not permitted:

- Physical punishment
- Corporal punishment
- Deprivation of food
- Humiliation
- Shouting in anger
- Locking children in rooms
- Withholding contact as punishment (unless agreed in care plan)

Sanctions must be reasonable, proportionate, and recorded.

---

### 🛠 Effective Behaviour Strategies

Helpful approaches include:

- Positive reinforcement
- Praise and recognition
- Natural consequences
- Restorative conversations
- Clear routines
- Visual schedules (for younger children or those with additional needs)
- Time to calm down (not isolation)

Focus on repairing relationships after incidents.

---

### 🗣 De-escalation Techniques

If behaviour escalates:

- Lower your voice.
- Reduce audience (move to a quieter space if safe).
- Offer choices.
- Acknowledge feelings.
- Give time and space.
- Avoid power struggles.

If there is immediate risk of harm, follow safeguarding procedures.

---

### ⚠️ Physical Intervention

Physical intervention should only be used:

- As a last resort.
- To prevent immediate harm.
- By trained carers.
- In line with agreed policy.

All incidents involving restraint must:

- Be recorded.
- Be reported immediately.
- Be reviewed.

---

### 📝 Recording Behaviour Incidents

Record:

- What happened before (triggers).
- The behaviour itself (factually).
- Your response.
- Outcome.
- Any injuries.
- Who was informed.

Do not use judgemental language.

Behaviour logs help identify patterns and improve support plans.

---

### 📊 Behaviour Support Plans

Some children will have a Behaviour Support Plan outlining:

- Known triggers
- De-escalation strategies
- Agreed responses
- Risk factors

You must follow the agreed plan consistently.

Plans should be reviewed after significant incidents.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Working With Professionals

You may work alongside:

- Social workers
- Schools
- CAMHS
- Therapists
- Youth offending services (where relevant)

Share information appropriately and attend relevant meetings.

---

### 💛 Promoting Positive Development

Celebrate:

- Small achievements
- School attendance
- Emotional regulation
- Kindness
- Effort

Children in care may have rarely experienced consistent praise.

Positive reinforcement builds confidence and stability.

---

### 🛡 Why This Matters

Under the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 and National Minimum Standards:

- Physical punishment is prohibited.
- Behaviour management must promote welfare.
- Children must be treated with dignity and respect.

Ofsted will look for:

- Consistent approaches
- Trauma-informed responses
- Evidence of reflection and review
- Appropriate recording
- Reduced reliance on police involvement
