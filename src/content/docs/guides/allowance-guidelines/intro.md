Foster carers are treated as **self-employed** for tax purposes.

Allowances are:
- Paid gross (before tax)

- Paid fortnightly
- Transferred directly to your bank account

Payment may occasionally be delayed due to bank holidays.

Payments stop when a child leaves your care.

You will receive an **annual statement** for tax purposes.

## 🎂 Birthdays, Festivals & Christmas

The weekly allowance includes a contribution towards:

- Birthdays
- Cultural or religious festivals
- Christmas

It is recommended that carers budget weekly to spread the cost across the year.

If a placement lasts less than a year, this should be calculated on a pro-rata basis.

---

## 🧒 Pocket Money & Savings

Pocket money must be paid to each child.

Amounts should be:
- Age appropriate
- Agreed at the Placement Planning Meeting

### 💡 General Guidance

Typically:
- A percentage of the allowance is allocated to pocket money and savings
- The split increases with age
- Savings are encouraged for independence

Children should understand:
- The importance of saving
- That savings support independence
- That increased pocket money reduces savings

Any increase beyond standard guidance must be agreed with the Supervising Social Worker.

All direct payments to children must be:
- Recorded
- Signed for by both carer and child

---

## 🏦 Savings Accounts

Where possible:

- A savings account should be opened for each child
- Regular deposits should be made
- Accounts must be separate from carer accounts

Savings should be discussed and agreed at the Placement Meeting.

The aim is to:
- Encourage financial responsibility
- Support young people leaving care

---

## 🚗 Travel Costs

The allowance includes routine travel such as:

- School runs
- Medical appointments
- Family contact
- Everyday activities

If additional travel is required beyond routine expectations, speak to your Supervising Social Worker.

---

## 💡 Additional Expenses

Sometimes extra costs arise.

If an expense falls outside routine or exceptional costs:

1. Discuss with your Supervising Social Worker
2. They will negotiate with the Local Authority if appropriate
3. Do not assume reimbursement without agreement

Examples of exceptional costs may include:
- Initial clothing purchases
- School residential trips
- Specialist equipment
- Glasses
- Music lessons
- Entrance fees for specific activities

Approval must be obtained before significant expenditure.

---

## 🏖 Holidays

The allowance includes the cost of taking a fostered child on holiday.

All holidays must:
- Be discussed with your Supervising Social Worker
- Be authorised by the Local Authority

---

## 🛌 Respite

The allowance includes a short-term respite element.

If respite is used:
- Payment arrangements must be agreed in advance
- Nominated carers must be approved
- DBS checks and assessment are required

Overnight respite must always be authorised.

---

## 🛡 Insurance

Wholistic provides employment-related insurance cover.

Carers are strongly advised to:
- Extend home insurance
- Ensure personal possessions are covered
- Consider legal protection cover

Claims through Local Authority insurance can be complex and may include an excess.

---

## 📊 Tax & National Insurance

Foster carers are classed as self-employed.

A special tax scheme applies (often called Qualifying Care Relief).

In summary:

- There is a fixed annual tax threshold
- Additional weekly amounts per child increase the threshold
- If your fostering income stays below the threshold, no tax is due
- If income exceeds the threshold, tax may apply

You must:
- Register as self-employed
- Keep accurate records
- Complete a Self-Assessment Tax Return if required

Records must be kept for at least six years.

If unsure, seek professional financial advice.

---

## 📁 Record Keeping

You must keep records of:

- Total fostering income
- Weeks each child is in placement
- Age of each child
- Additional expenditure (if using profit method)

Accurate records protect you financially.

---

## 🌟 The Principle Behind the Allowance

The fostering allowance exists to:

- Meet children’s full needs
- Promote stability
- Support development
- Encourage independence

It is not profit-driven.

It is outcome-driven.

Every financial decision should support:

**Safety. Stability. Future success.**
