## 🗂 Planning for Children in Foster Care

Every child in care must have a clear plan.

This usually includes:
- A Care Plan
- A Placement Plan
- A Health Plan
- A Personal Education Plan (PEP)
- A Pathway Plan (for older young people preparing for independence)

The Care Plan sets out the long-term plan for the child.

Foster carers:
- Contribute to planning
- Attend meetings and reviews
- Help children understand their plan
- Support children to share their views

Plans should be shared with carers and reviewed regularly.

See:
- Care Planning Policy
- Placement Planning Policy

## 🏠 The Placement Plan

The Placement Plan explains how the child will be cared for day-to-day.

It covers:
- Delegated authority (what decisions you can make)
- Health arrangements
- Education
- Contact with family
- House rules
- Financial arrangements (e.g. pocket money, clothing)

It should be agreed at the start of placement (or shortly after if urgent).

- Placement Planning Policy

Maintaining family relationships is usually important.

Contact arrangements are agreed as part of the Care Plan.

Contact may:

- Be unsupervised
- Be indirect (letters, calls, online)

Contact can be emotional for children.

Foster carers support children by:

If contact becomes unsafe or distressing, inform your SSW immediately.

See:

## 👂 Listening to Children

Children’s views must be heard and taken seriously.

This includes:

- Feelings about contact
- Views on school
- Day-to-day preferences

If their wishes cannot be acted on, they should be given an explanation.

Children should:
- Understand their identity and background
