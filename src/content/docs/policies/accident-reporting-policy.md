title: Accident Reporting Policy And Procedure
---


## Policy Statement

This organisation recognises its responsibility to ensure that all
reasonable precautions are taken to provide working conditions that are
safe, healthy and compliant with all statutory requirements and codes of
practice.

The organisation recognises that even in the safest of working
environments accidents are, from time to time, inevitable.

The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires employers to ensure the
health, safety and welfare of all their employees as far as is
reasonably practicable.

As part of this commitment, employers must, by law, notify certain
categories of accidents, specified cases of ill health and specified
dangerous occurrences to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) or the
local authority (LA) to comply with the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases
and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR).

## Aim of the Policy

This policy is intended to set out the values, principles and policies
underpinning this organisation\'s approach to accident reporting, to
enable the organisation to meet the requirements of the Reporting of
Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR)
and to prevent the recurrence of incidents in the future as far as it is
possible.

The goals of the organisation are to ensure that:

      * a) the organisation complies fully with the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR)
      * b) all accidents and incidents involving injury to staff or service users are reported and recorded, no matter how minor
      * c) all reported accidents or incidents are fully investigated
      * d) the results and recommendations from investigations are fully implemented to prevent or minimise any recurrence of such incidents.

## Accident Reporting

Accident reports are covered by the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). RIDDOR requires
employers to:

      * a) keep adequate records of accidents and injuries
      * b) report fatal accidents immediately to the Incident Contact Centre
      * c) report major injuries immediately to the Incident Contact Centre
      * d) report dangerous occurrences immediately to the Incident Contact Centre
      * e) report specified diseases to the Incident Contact Centre

A report is required in the following circumstances\...

1\. A fatality (to an employee or a non-employee).

2\. A major injury to an employee, including:

      * a) skull, spine or pelvic fractures
      * b) any other fracture other than to fingers, thumbs or toes
      * c) any amputation
      * d) dislocation of the shoulder, hip, knee or spine
      * e) loss of sight (temporary or permanent)
      * f) chemical burn to the eye or penetrating injury
      * g) any injury resulting from an electric shock or electrical burn leading to unconsciousness or requiring resuscitation or admittance to hospital for more than 24 hours
      * h) any other injury leading to hypothermia, heat-induced illness or unconsciousness, requiring resuscitation, or requiring hospital admission for more than 24 hours
      * i) loss of consciousness caused by asphyxia or exposure to a harmful substance or biological agent
      * j) absorption of any substance by inhalation, ingestion or through the skin leading to acute illness requiring medical treatment or resulting in loss of consciousness
      * k) acute illness requiring treatment where there is reason to believe this resulted from exposure to a biological agent or its toxins or infected materials
      * l) any other injury which results in the person being admitted immediately into hospital for 24 hours or more

An employee being unable to carry out normal work for seven successive
days. An overseven-day injury is one which is not major but results in
the injured person being away from work or unable to do the full range
of their normal duties for more than seven days (including any days they
wouldn\'t normally be expected to work such as weekends, rest days or
holidays) not counting the day of the injury itself

3\. Dangerous occurrences, including:

      * a. lifting machinery
      * b. pressure systems
      * c. electrical short circuit
      * d. biological agents
      * e. collapse of scaffolding, building or structure
      * f. explosion or fire
      * g. escape of flammable substances

Note: Reportable dangerous occurrences are potentially dangerous
incidents (e.g. the collapse of part of a building or scaffolding,
accidental ignition of explosives and the release of large quantities of
flammable liquid), which must be notified to the enforcing authority
even if they do not, in fact, cause injury.

4\. Reportable diseases. The list of reportable diseases is split into
two parts; there are 72 listed under the following three categories:

      * a. conditions due to physical agents and the physical demands of work
      * b. infections due to biological agents
      * c. conditions due to substance.

5\. Notifiable diseases which include cholera, food poisoning, smallpox,
typhus, dysentery, measles, meningitis, mumps, rabies, rubella, tetanus,
typhoid fever, viral haemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, whooping cough,
leptospirosis, tuberculosis and yellow fever.

## Procedures

A written record should be kept of any accident, however minor, that
occurs in the organisation. Three types of records should be made.

      * 1. An Accident Book is provided in the agency's main office to keep a record of all accidents which occur in the organisation, whether they are Notifiable or not, whether they occur in a service user's home, in the street or in the office, and whether or not they happen to a member of staff, a contractor, a service user or a relative.

      * 2. Accident/incident report forms are also available in the Organisation Paperwork File. One of these should be filled in by the person suffering from the accident or by a member of staff. Forms should be witnessed and counter-signed by the witness.

      * 3. For reportable accidents listed above, HSE report forms F2508 are also available from the HSE website [[https://www.hse.gov.uk/forms/incident/|F2508IE]]. These forms must be completed and sent to the relevant enforcing authority within 15 days of the incident or accident.

Note: Fatal accidents, major injury accidents/conditions and dangerous
occurrences must be reported immediately by telephone to the enforcing
authority by the head of the agency or their nominated deputy and
followed up by the appropriate form.

Telephone notification should always be followed up with submission of
form F2508. Notification forms should be completed by the head of the
organisation, their deputy or by a senior member of staff as soon as
possible after the accident. Copies of the completed form should be
kept.

All incidents can be reported online but a telephone service remains for
reporting fatal and major injuries only - call the Incident Contact
Centre on 0845 300 9923 (opening hours Monday to Friday 8.30 am to 5
pm).

Contacting HSE out of hours The types of circumstances where HSE may
need to respond out of hours are:

      * following a work-related death 
      * following a serious incident where there have been multiple casualties
      * following an incident which has caused major disruption such as evacuation of People, closure of roads, large numbers of people going to hospital etc.

If your incident fits these descriptions ring the duty officer on 0151
922 9235.

On-line reporting and relevant reporting forms can be located and
completed at www.hse.gov.uk/forms/incident/index.htm

There is a legal requirement that written records of reportable
accidents and dangerous occurrences (i.e. those which must be reported
to the appropriate enforcing authority) be kept for a minimum of three
years.

It is the policy of the organisation that all records should include:

      * a) the date, time and place of incident that occurred
      * b) the name, address and role/job of the injured or ill person
      * c) details of the injury/illness and what first aid was given
      * d) what happened to the person immediately afterwards (for example went to organisation, went back to work, went to hospital)
      * e) the name and signature of the first aider or person dealing with or witnessing the incident. 

## Training

All employees of the organisation must be given adequate training and
information on accidents at work and how to avoid them. Such training
should focus on specific risk areas.

All new staff should be encouraged to read the policy on health and
safety and on accident reporting as part of their induction process.
