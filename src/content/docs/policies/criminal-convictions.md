title: Criminal Convictions Policy
---


Wholistic Fostering has a range of statutory duties which it must
undertake when assessing and approving Foster Carers. These laws, rules,
standards and safeguards have been put in place to ensure the safety and
welfare of any looked after child who may be placed with Foster Carers.

This documents sets out the Agency's standards in relation to applicants
who wish to be assessed as Foster Carers or for Foster Carers who have
already been approved who receive criminal convictions.

Carers must notify the Agency without delay if their personal
circumstances change. Failure to do so could affect the placement of
children and/or their approval status.

## Checks

As part of the assessment, Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks at an
enhanced level will be conducted on the following people:-

      * The Foster Carer applicants
      * The applicant’s family members over the age of 16
      * Any other adult members of the applicants household
      * Any family members or family friends who will or may have significant and/or unsupervised contact with a foster child

Current CRB practice is that not all members of a support network should
be CRB checked and the Dept of Health guidance on Overnight Stays should
be used as guidance (LAC 04\[2004\]).

Where there are children in the household under 16 years and above the
age of criminal responsibility, their parents/applicants will be
required to sign an undertaking stating that they do not have a criminal
record.

Enhanced CRB checks will be repeated at least every three years on any
of the above people and the will be registered by the Independent
Safeguarding Authority on the vetting and barring scheme.

The information gained from a CRB check is confidential and cannot be
shared with other members of the household unless the person it concerns
has given their authority for the information to be shared. Staff should
seek their Line Manager's guidance before dealing with such situations.

## If a person has a conviction

Where an applicant or a member of their household has a conviction and
it is considered as being against the guidance at the bottom of this
document (issued by DoH) their application cannot proceed.

Some offences automatically disqualify people from becoming foster
carers. For example any convictions for offences against a child within
the meaning of s26 (1) of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act
2000, or any other offence involving bodily injury to a child; or any
convictions for offences relating to importing indecent photographs of
children, or offences under s7 of the Sex offenders Act 1997 (relating
to sexual offences against children abroad).

The Agency takes a dim view of any applicants who has failed to disclose
information about past convictions which are later revealed either
through the CRB checking process or other means such as references. In
such situations the failure to disclose can frequently be more serious
than the conviction itself due to trust being broken.

## Existing Carers

Any existing Foster Carer must notify the Agency if they are arrested,
charged with or convicted of any offence. Failure to do so may result in
the suspension and/or termination of the Foster Carer's approval.

In most cases of a report of the above being received by the Agency a
Foster Carer Review should be instigated immediately. In such cases the
review should be presented to the Agency's fostering panel for their
consideration and recommendation.

## Notifications

Depending on the nature of the offence, it may be necessary to inform
the placing LA of any child who may be in placement and depending on the
alleged offences a decision to terminate the placements of any children
placed with that Carer may be made.

## Making Decisions

Not all offences render a Foster Carer unfit. However, for those
offences outside of this guidance, the number of offences and the period
of time that they have occurred along with when the last offence was
committed should be taken into consideration when deciding on a person's
fitness to foster.

The Registered Manager must make a decision on whether the applicant can
continue with their assessment or for existing Carers whether the Carer
needs to be presented to the fostering panel for their consideration.

The decision maker will make a final decision on the Carer based on the
guidance below, the panel recommendations and any other possible
mitigating factors.

## Record Keeping

Completed and returned CRB checks will be checked against any
information provided by the individual concerned as part of the
assessment process.

In all cases where a recorded item is returned the SSW and Registered
Manager must be notified.

When completed checks have been returned the SSW will make a note of the
outcome of the check, its date and number on the Carers Form F.

Where a discrepancy exists between the disclosed information and the
information provided by the CRB check the Registered Manager must be
informed and he/she will provide guidance on how to proceed. For
existing Foster Cares these details will be recorded on their review
report.
