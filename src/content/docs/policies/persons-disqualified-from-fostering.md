title: Persons Disqualified from Fostering
---


## - Scope

This section explains which people are disqualified and therefore not
eligible to be assessed as foster parents

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 13 Recruiting and Assessing
Foster Carers (<http://www.minimumstandards.org/fost_thirteen.html>)

A person is disqualified from acting as a foster parent for Wholistic
Fostering (unless a relative of the child or already acting as a foster
parent) if s/he or any adult member of the household has been cautioned
for or convicted of a specified offence committed at the age of 18 or
over.

A specified offence is defined as offence against a child\*, an offence
specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4 of the Fostering Services Regulations
2011 , the importation/possession of indecent photographs of a child
under 16 and any other offence which involves bodily injury to a child
(other than common assault or battery),.

\*A list of these offences is set out in the Criminal Justice and Court
Services Act 2000, except that it does not include an offence contrary
to section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (sexual activity with a
child) where the offender was under 20 when the offence was committed
and the child was aged 13 or over.

In addition, a person is disqualified from acting as a foster carer for
the agency (unless a relative of the child or already acting as a foster
carer) if s/he or any adult member of the household has been cautioned
for or convicted of an offence specified in paragraph 1 of part 2 of
Schedule 4 of the Fostering Services Regulations 2011committed at the
age of 18 or over OR falls within paragraph 2 or 3 of Part 2 of Schedule
4, notwithstanding that the offences listed have been repealed.

## - New Applications

Where Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks reveal that an
applicant for approval as a foster parent is a disqualified person, the
applicants must be advised that their application cannot proceed. This
must be confirmed in writing to them, together with the reasons, and
retained with their application form.

Where the applicant is a relative or friend of the child seeking
approval as a foster carer for a specific child and the person would
otherwise be regarded as disqualified, an application for consent to
proceed with the assessment in relation to the particular child can be
considered by our Agency Decision Maker on the recommendation of the
Fostering Panel.

In these circumstances, the assessing social worker responsible for
carrying out the checks on the prospective foster carer should prepare a
report on the application setting out:

      * a. The reasons for the application
      * b. The circumstances surrounding the conviction or caution which would result in the person being disqualified unless consent is given
      * c. An assessment of whether the placement would meet the child’s needs despite the conviction/caution and
      * d. A recommendation as to whether the application should proceed.

The assessing social worker will arrange with the Panel Administrator a
date for the Panel to consider the report and the report should be sent
to the Panel Administrator 10 working days before the relevant Panel
meeting.

The Panel minutes will be sent to the Agency Decision Maker, who will
consider the recommendation of the Fostering Panel on any such
applications.

The decision of the Agency Decision Maker will be recorded in writing
and a copy placed on the case record of the applicant. A copy of the
decision will also be sent to the person concerned.

## - Approved Foster Carers

Where information is provided or updating Criminal Records Bureau checks
reveal that an approved foster carer has been convicted of or cautioned
for a criminal offence as a result of which he or she will become a
disqualified person unless consent is given, an urgent review of the
foster carer's approval will be held and a written report detailing the
circumstances leading to the conviction/caution, together with
background information from the foster carer's case record, will be
presented to the Fostering Panel as soon as possible. The report should
contain a recommendation on whether consent should be granted to allow
the foster carer to continue to be approved as a foster carer for the
(named) child or children currently in placement.

The report should be sent to the Panel Administrator at least 15 working
days before the relevant Panel meeting.

Where such information is received, the social worker for any child
currently in the placement must be informed and plans for the
termination of the placement will also need to be considered as
appropriate.

Where the report recommends the termination of approval of the foster
carer, the report should be presented to the earliest possible Fostering
Panel.

The Agency Decision Maker will consider the recommendation of the
Fostering Panel on any such applications.

The decision of the Agency Decision Maker will be recorded in writing
and a copy placed on the case record of the foster carer.

Written notice of the decision, together with reasons, must then be sent
to the foster carer as soon as practicable.

Where a decision is made to terminate the approval of the foster carer,
the Representations Procedure will apply although they will not have a
right to request an Independent review -- see Review of Foster Carers
Procedure, Section 6: Representations/Independent Review Procedure.
