title: 📋 Persons Disqualified from Fostering Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-17

## 📘 Scope

This policy applies to all new and existing foster carers registered
with Wholistic Fostering.

## ❌ Who is Disqualified from Fostering?

A person is automatically disqualified from fostering if they, or any
adult in their household, have been cautioned or convicted (aged 18 or
over) of:

-   Any offence against a child (as set out in the Criminal Justice and
    Court Services Act 2000)
-   Offences listed in Part 1 of Schedule 4 of the Fostering Services
    Regulations 2011
-   Importing or possessing indecent images of a child under 16
-   Any other offence causing bodily harm to a child (except common
    assault)

👉 These rules apply unless the applicant is a relative or friend of the
child.

Any failure to disclose a relevant caution or conviction will end the
assessment process immediately.

## 📝 New Applications

If a DBS check reveals a disqualifying offence, the applicant will be
informed in writing and their application closed.

However, if the applicant is a **relative/friend** of the child, an
**exception** may be considered. The assessing social worker must
prepare a report for the Fostering Panel, including:

1.  Background of the caution/conviction
2.  Impact on the child
3.  Reasons for making an exception
4.  Recommendation

The Fostering Panel will review this and make a recommendation to the
**Agency Decision Maker**, who will confirm the decision in writing and
record it in the applicant\'s file.

## ✅ Existing Foster Carers

If an approved foster carer (or adult in their home) receives a new
caution or conviction that would result in disqualification:

-   An **urgent review** will be held
-   A report will go to the Fostering Panel with a recommendation
-   Children's social workers will be informed
-   Placement decisions may be reviewed

If termination is recommended, the case will be presented to the Panel
and the **Agency Decision Maker** will issue a formal decision in
writing.

If approval is ended, carers may request a review through the
**Representations/Independent Review Mechanism**.

## 🛑 Important Note

All decisions, whether to proceed or terminate approval, must be clearly
recorded, communicated to all parties, and stored securely.
