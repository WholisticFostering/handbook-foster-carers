title: Conflict of Interest Policy
---


## - Background

The Directors of Wholistic Fostering are committed to prioritising the
safety of young people and to preserving the integrity of decision
making processes in all areas of the agency. Clarity, openness and
honesty are essential for integrity.

## - Policy

Conflicts of interest should be avoided by close adherence to the
procedures outlined in this policy and by adherence to the spirit of the
policy as stated above. It is the duty of all members of staff and
foster carers to be open and vigilant. A policy is necessary because:
Conflicts may create problems, they can:

      * Inhibit free discussion
      * Result in actions that are not in the best interests of children/young people or foster parents
      * Result in decisions that are not in the best interests of the agency
      * Risk the impression that the agency has acted improperly
      * Result in decisions that may be biased

## - Aim

The aim of this policy is to protect both the agency and the individuals
involved from any appearance of impropriety.

## - Foster Parent(s)

      * Foster parent'sneed to be aware that from time to time a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest may arise which could interfere with their caring role. You must declare to your supervising social worker any financial or non financial interests that you consider may bring you into conflict with your primary role of caring for a looked after child or young person for Wholistic Fostering. A conflict of interest may affect the way you view a child placed with you, their parents and family, or the professionals involved. It is however also recognised that you may not experience such conflicts of interest whilst caring for other people’s children. Examples of a conflict of interest could be as follows:
      * Social workers unknowingly proposing to place a child related or well known to you through family, neighbourhood or work connections
      * A child placed with you is registered with a GPs practice or attends a school with whom you had a disagreement which led to a change of doctor or school.
      * Invitation to serve on another agencies panel.
      * After a child is placed you come to know members of the child’s family through other employment, a family member moving into your locality or through marriage or relationship with other members of their family. When placements last longer than originally envisaged this may occur on occasions.

If you consider a possible conflict of interest may arise from caring
for a certain child/ren, you should feel free to raise it with your
supervising social worker. If you are not sure whether you should
declare an interest and wish to discuss the matter in confidence, the
Fostering Network can offer advice. Fostering Network can be contacted
at:

87 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 8HA Tel: 020 7620 640.

Although you can be offered advice about declaring an interest, it is
ultimately your responsibility: if you are not sure, then it is always
best to declare an interest. It is important to remember that declaring
an interest does not imply that you may act improperly, but that it
could protect you from claims or the potential appearance of
impropriety.

Once a declaration has been made the supervising social worker, in
consultation with their manager, will agree an appropriate course of
action with you to ensure the care of a child to be placed or placed is
not jeopardised. A declaration of a possible conflict of interest to
your supervising social worker should help to prevent inappropriate
placements occurring. A declaration of a possible conflict of interest
once a placement has started does not necessarily mean a placement
should be terminated. Once a potential conflict of interest has been
identified, all involved need to be aware of potential difficulties and
jointly plan how matters should be handled and/or resolved.

Decisions should be made in the interests of young people and not
influenced by individual needs of staff or influenced by loyalties
external to the agency.If the conflict concerns other employment they
may be required to take appropriate action to minimise conflict.

Interests should be declared at or before a meeting at which the
decision in question will be considered. If the issue will not be raised
within the next 4 weeks, it should be declared to the line manager or a
Director at the earliest opportunity.

There are numerous ways of addressing a conflict of interest. The person
in question might absent themselves completely from all consideration,
or they may participate in the discussion but not the decision.

## - Foster Panel

Wholistic Fostering aims to limit the risk of any conflicts of interest
arising during the assessment and approval of foster carers. Conflicts
are likely to be exceptional and would be unlikely to affect overall
membership of the panel.

Independent members of the panel should not be employed by the
agency.Members of the Management Team may not be appointed as
independent members of the Panel.

Persons related to any employee of the agency may not be appointed to
the Panel. Persons related to the management team may not be appointed
to the Panel.

In addition to this, panel members are asked at the beginning of every
panel meeting to declare any interest they may have in the Foster
Parents presented to panel. This may range from knowledge of the family
through links in the community to a family connection or some
involvement in the assessment process. The Chair of the panel will then
ask the panel to decide whether the level of interest should eliminate
that member from participating in the discussion and/or decision making
process.

The Agency Decision Maker has no part in the assessment or panel
processes and makes their decision based on the recommendations of the
panel and their own independent assessment of the assessment report,
checks and references obtained.

## - Line Management

Line management and staff supervision are areas where conflict of
interest might arise,if staff members are related to each other or are
friends outside of the agency. The management team discuss any such
issues in monthly management meetings and ensure such conflicts are
avoided.

## - Supervision of Foster

Members of staff who supervise and support foster parents may know them
through links in the community. This should become apparent through the
assessment process and again the Directors have a clear expectation of
honesty and openness from all employees.

The Management Team will take appropriate steps to ensure that carers
are not supervised by someone known to them in another capacity.

## - Annual Reviews

Wholistic Fostering aims to employ an Independent Reviewing Officer as
soon as the

agency is of sufficient size for this to be practical. In order to avoid
conflict of interest in the meantime, annual reviews are undertaken by
panel.

## - Other Employment

Members of staff are required in their Terms and Conditions of
Employment to declare to the Directors of the agency any other
employment that may lead to a conflict of interest with Wholistic
Fostering. They are required not to undertake any employment or outside
activities that may conflict with the aims or operation of the agency.

## - Data Protection

Information on conflicts of interest will be recorded in the appropriate
minutes. The information will be processed in accordance with data
protection principles as set out in the Data Protection Act 1998. Data
will be processed only to ensure that the Directors and senior members
of staff act in the best interests of Wholistic Fostering and those
associated with the agency. The information provided will not be used
for any other purpose.

## - Advice to staff and foster parent

If you are a user of Wholistic Fostering services or the foster parent
of someone who uses the service, you should not be involved in decisions
that directly affect the service that you,or the person for which you
care, receive(s). You should declare your interest at the earliest
opportunity and withdraw from any subsequent discussion. The same
applies if you face a conflict for any other reason. You may, however,
participate in discussions from which you may indirectly benefit, for
example where the benefits are universal to all users or where your
benefit is minimal. If you fail to declare an interest that is known to
senior staff members they will declare that interest on your behalf. In
the event of the Directors having to decide upon a question in which a
member of staff has an interest, all decisions will be made by a vote
with a simple majority required.

## - Agency action

Where an undisclosed conflict of interest is found or suspected,
investigation will be made by either the line manager or Director as
appropriate.If the conflict is related to a Director an independent
investigator will be appointed and disciplinary procedures may apply.

All decisions under a conflict of interest will be recorded by the chair
of the meeting and reported in the minutes of that meeting. The report
will record:

      * The nature and the extent of the conflict;
      * An outline of the discussion;
      * The actions taken to manage the conflict.

## - Management of the agency

The Responsible Individual and Registered Manager are common-law
partners as such if the conflict is related to either of these then an
independent investigator will be appointed and disciplinary procedures
may apply.
