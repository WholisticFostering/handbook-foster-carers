## Scope

This chapter explains the way in which the fostering agency promotes
education for children in its care.

This chapter is compliant with National Minimum Standards for Fostering
2011, Standard 8 Promoting Educational Achievement.

## Education Policy (see also WF Practice Guidance)

Obtaining a good education can be the key to vastly improving everyone's
chances in life. Children in care can be particularly disadvantaged
educationally. They will often have had their education disrupted as a
result of changes of placements and circumstances, and may not have had
the opportunity to develop to their full potential. They may have little
sense of their abilities and will need encouragement to develop greater
self-esteem.

WF is committed to providing foster placements that provide a stable,
supportive environment from which children can take full advantage of
educational opportunities. It is vital that this chance is taken to
promote education as valuable in itself and as part of preparation for
adulthood.

Foster carers should ensure that their house has a routine that is
organised so as to further children's participation in education,
including private study and maintaining effective links with any schools
attended by children at the home.

The foster carers and staff of the agency will be actively involved with
Designated Teachers and relevant others to support and plan each child's
educational arrangements.

If a child is absent from school, the foster carer will inform the
school on the morning of the day of absence unless an alternative
arrangement (for example for a recurring appointment) has been made.

## What the agency will do

WF actively demonstrates that education is valued throughout the
organisation by ensuring that:

      * Placements will only be suggested to local authorities when is satisfied that it can meet the educational needs of the child, or work together with local authority if additional services are required like for example transportation or home tuition. 
      * Every child should have an up to date Personal Education Plan (PEP) and Individual Education Plan (IEP) and WF expect this to be available before the child is placed or that it is requested from the child’s social worker at the first placement planning meeting. It is the child’s social worker that takes the lead in facilitating PEP and IEP meetings to discuss and complete the PEP and IEP’s.  WF will request these if none have been completed, and will continue to do so until a PEP and IEP is in place.  
      * If the child has special educational needs or disabilities, an up to date copy of the child’s Statement of Special Educational Needs (SEN) will be requested prior to the placement to ensure that the child’s special needs can be met in the placement;
      * Pre-school children will be provided with educational opportunities
      * Children will be encouraged and supported to undertake further and higher education;
      * All efforts will be made to ensure children attend a local school or college; where this is not possible, the agency will work with the child’s placing authority and the relevant education service to identify a school within reasonable distance which meets their needs or alternatively to facilitate the provision of specialist tuition;
      * The parents of children placed are encouraged (if appropriate) to take an interest in and to promote the education of their child;
      * Children’s achievements are recognised in a manner acceptable to them;  Records of children’s educational achievement show progress towards targets / goals;
      * Arrangements will be made to facilitate children in agency foster placements to have access to a computer;
      * The child should have an appropriate area for completing study and doing homework;

## What foster carers will do

Foster carers will actively demonstrate that education is valued
throughout the organisation by ensuring, in relation to children placed
with them, that:

      * They actively promote the children’s education and learning and find ways to introduce aspects of the curriculum into their day to day activities in the home;
      * They are fully conversant with the children’s educational needs and any plans that have been agreed with Placing Authorities;
      * They establish close working relationships with teaching staff at the children’s schools and attend parents evenings;
      * They encourage the children to leave for school in good time and, where they are not escorted to school, liaison takes place with the school to ensure that there are no issues regarding attendance or lateness;
      * They ensure that children/ young people have all the necessary equipment to complete their homework;
      * They support children to participate in leisure opportunities and out-of-school activities
      * They encourage children to use local libraries and other educational facilities;
      * They assist young people who have completed their compulsory full time education to make arrangements for their continued training and employment.
