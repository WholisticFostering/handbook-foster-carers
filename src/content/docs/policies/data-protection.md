  -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Employee's/ workers\' responsibilities

Workers have responsibility for data protection under the Act. Line
managers have responsibility for the type of personal data they collect
and how they use them. No worker should disclose personal data outside
the organisation\'s procedures, or use personal data held on others for
their own purposes. A worker disclosing personal data without the
authority of the organisation may commit a criminal offence, unless
there is some other legal justification for example under
'whistleblowing' legislation and may be subject to disciplinary action.

Personal data is subject to the Data Protection legislation applicable
in each jurisdiction. Under the terms of the Act, personal data includes
any information about a living identifiable individual, including their
name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. If you include such
information in an e-mail or an attachment to an e-mail or fax, you are
deemed to be "processing" personal data and must abide by the law.

In particular, the company and employee must not;

      * collect personal data without the person’s knowledge
      * disclose or amend such information except in accordance with the purpose for which the information was collected
      * use personal data for purposes other than those for which it may have been explicitly collected.
      * Knowingly ignore or contravene safeguards that have been put in place regarding the storage and security of personal information.

### Guide to security procedures in the workplace

Wholistic Fostering shall ensure that facilities are available to data
processors that help prevent viewing by unauthorised individuals in the
form of physical and electronic locking devices; and data processors
shall make use of those facilities; and employ good administrative
practice to minimise the risk of unauthorised viewing. Wholistic
Fostering shall also ensure that reasonable measures are in place to
minimise personal data loss, damage, theft or inappropriate use.

### Secure lockable furniture

All paper-based records must be locked away when they are not in use, in
desks, filing cabinets, or cupboards. Keys should be kept in a safe
place and workers should adopt a clear desk policy. Secure equipment

All workers should take special care with computer screens, fax machines
and photocopiers.

      * Place equipment appropriately within secure areas.
      * Remove documents from photocopiers and fax machines after use.
      * Make sure only authorised staff/workers can collect incoming faxes.
      * When sending a confidential fax, ensure that the correct fax address is held, and that the receiving organisation is aware that a confidential fax is being transmitted.
      * If printing confidential information to a photocopier ensure you use the ‘locked print’ facility if it is available
      * Lock the computer screen whenever desks are unattended for a period of time.
      * Change computer passwords every 30 days in line with the company’s Electronic Communications Protocol
      * Shut down computers at the end of the working day.

The following section should be read in conjunction with the Company's
Electronic Communications Protocol.

### Securing electronic data

If you are in possession of a laptop provided for you by the company you
must take a common sense approach to securing/ storing your laptop when
not in use.

      * Do not leave your laptop in your car or unattended when travelling or visible on your desk when you are not working.
      * Take care when storing confidential personal records next to high value electronic items
      * Take care when travelling on public transport to ensure that you keep position of your device
      * Ensure that security passwords for the laptop are not kept

You may be asked to replace a laptop at your own cost if it has been
lost, stolen or damaged as a result of your negligence. If you do lose a
device, you must report it immediately.

### Removable media

The Company does not encourage the use of removable media for storing
personal information about staff or Wholistic Fostering members (e.g.
memory sticks, CDs, DVDs, USB hard drives etc.) as they carry a risk to
the organisation

However, in certain circumstances workers may be permitted to use
removable media devices while on Company business, e.g. in order to
carry out their role effectively. Only encrypted devices may be used.
The devices should be password protected and the password kept in a safe
place, and not near the device. When removable media is not in use it
must be stored securely. Any loss or theft of a device must be reported
immediately.

Please note: Any removable media issued by the Company forms part of the
Company's equipment and should therefore be returned upon leaving the
organisation

### Reporting procedures for lost removable media

Lost or stolen media should be reported immediately to the Managing
Director as this may constitute a breach of Data Protection legislation
and could expose the company to significant fines in respect of breach
of confidentiality, and distress or damage to data subjects. See also:
action to be taken in the event of a breach of this policy

### Password protected documents

Any personal data pertaining to a worker or a member should be held
securely and given password protection. All documents containing
personal data must be password protected prior to being sent
electronically to another worker. The password must not be shared within
the body of the text containing the attachment.

### Securing archive data

The DPA operates with the requirement that the data subject's data be
destroyed as soon as it is no longer required. However, this requirement
has to be balanced with the need to retain certain data to meet other
legal requirements, such as care standards, employment law or taxation.

The general requirement of this policy in relation to data no longer
"live" shall therefore be to destroy it; or if retention is required
(following an assessment made of what needs to be stored and why), To
store it on the company database for no longer than required, except in
exceptional circumstances.

Please refer to [Archive and Retention
Policy](/polciies/archive-and-retention-policy)

### Guide to retention of data

The company uses a Database whereby documents and other information can
be stored electronically and accessed by staff that have relevant
permissions. This limits the need for Shared drives/ folders. Data
should only be retained for as long as necessary, and then deleted.
Personal data must not be held on personal drives, but retained on the
database and in shared folders where needed for specific reasons such as
data analysis or mailings. Holding data in shared files ensures that the
data can be appropriately secured, and accessed by staff who have a
legitimate requirement.

### Accuracy

Data processors have an on-going obligation to ensure data remains
accurate and within the law. In practice this will mean processes and
procedures are in place to periodically review the relevance and
accuracy of personal data; and data that is found to be inaccurate or
not required will be immediately destroyed.

Data controllers and processors may apply a degree of discretion on the
issue of accuracy. For example, if a letter on file was headed with an
out-of-date address, but the content remained relevant, then the data
processor should be able to justify the retention of the document as
long as the reason for keeping it is valid.

Where a member of Wholistic Fostering staff or contractor becomes aware
of a change to personal data, such as a change of name, address or other
personal data, they have a responsibility to either update the record,
or inform the person responsible for maintaining database records.

### Statistical data

Wholistic Fostering regards historical statistical data as an important
component in determining future trends. The retention of anonymised data
for statistical purposes is therefore permitted subject to any data that
identifies an individual being removed or modified.

### Employment Application Forms

Applications for non-successful candidates shall be retained within the
HR department for 6 months following the closing date of the vacancy. At
this point the application forms will be securely destroyed. Where
copies of application forms are made as part of the interview process,
they must be returned to Human Resources within 48 hours of the
interview (please refer to the staff recruitment procedure).

### HR files for employees/ workers

The following information for permanent employees can be held locally by
the appropriate Senior Manager in a secure environment in accordance
with the Data Protection Act, and may be used for the following
purposes; supervision, learning and development, managing performance,
and in responding to reference requests. Skeleton HR files can be must
be kept in a secure lockable cabinet and only accessed by authorised
personnel.

Local files should consist of the following:

      * basic personal information sheet (provided by HR) which includes next of kin details
      * job description/person specification
      * annual leave card
      * supervision notes
      * Performance and Development Review documentation
      * record of training/ personal development plan

Line Managers at Wholistic Fostering should regularly review their local
HR files to ensure the information is up to date and relevant. Any
information which is irrelevant/ out of date or is duplicated with
records held by HR should be securely destroyed. Information should not
be held where there is no genuine business need for it or no legal duty
to retain it.

Any correspondence written locally in relation to the employee must be
forwarded to HR to be placed on the Central file. Once an employee
leaves the Company any information stored on the local HR files should
be forwarded to the HR department within 60 days of their departure to
be archived with the HR file and any duplication of data will be
destroyed.

### Self Employed contractor Files

Self Employed contractor files shall be retained (in secure conditions)
for a period no longer than 12 months following the conclusion of the
tasked assignment/ contract for services, at which point they will be
destroyed. Agency Workers Records

The employment agency will keep records of any agency workers used by
the Company. Any records kept by the Company should be filed in the name
of the agency and in date order. Once an agency worker has not been
active for 12 months, their records will be destroyed.

### Guide to destruction of personal data

Personal data, regardless of whether it is live or archived, shall be
destroyed responsibly as soon as retention cannot be justified. All
workers must utilise safe methods for destroying papers, i.e. by
shredding. The Company shall ensure that each office base has facilities
in place for data destruction and on their part employees/ workers shall
make every effort to use those facilities. No confidential paper records
may be placed into general waste paper bins or into recycling bins
without being shredded.

### Archiving

Once an employee or casual worker leaves the Company, their personnel
file is retained for 12 months (in lockable archive cabinets) in case it
needs to be accessed for references or further information pertaining to
the worker. After 12 months the file will be securely archived. After 6
years the file will be recalled to be safely destroyed. Payroll files
will be kept for 6 tax years following an employee/ casual worker
leaving the Company, after which point they will be securely destroyed.

### Electronic Data

Electronic information shall be held by the Company in accordance with
policies identified for manual records/ hard data. Employees should not
use their personal computers for company emails, or their company
computers for personal emails. They must ensure that emails are not
retained longer than the purpose for which they were collected, and are
held in such a way that they can easily be identified, reviewed and when
necessary, destroyed.

Any unused or obsolete computer equipment must be returned to the IT
Department so that it may be disposed of correctly and any data deleted
securely.

For more information/guidance please refer to the [Wholistic Fostering
Electronic Communications
Protocol.](/policies/wholistic-fostering-electronic-communications-protocol)

### Employees and casual workers

Once the employee or casual worker leaves the company their electronic
details on the HR database are set to 'archive'. The HR department shall
ensure that employment records are retained for statistical purposes
only and HR shall ensure that any data that identifies an individual is
removed or modified and any out of date or irrelevant data is removed.

### Guide to releasing data/ sharing information/ handling enquiries

Data processors shall understand who they are permitted to share their
data with (authorised individuals) and whether the data needs to be
filtered before being shared with a third party. All members of staff/
workers will be provided with training in responding to a request for
information. Requests for personal data must be restricted to what is
absolutely necessary for the task in hand and individuals should
understand the reason why personal data is being collected.

See also [Subject Access Request Policy and
Guidance.](/policies/subject-access-request-policy-and-guidance)

### Telephone enquiries

Remember the following.

      * Do not give out any personal information over the phone. The person should be told to apply in writing to the company. Please refer to Subject Access request guidance (Appendix 1)
      * Never give out information about another person. For example, you should not give friends or relatives of employee/workers their address details
      * Do not be bullied into giving information. The person requesting the information may not be who they say they are.

### Releasing data overseas

The eighth principle under the Act states that personal data shall not
be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic
Area (EEA) unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of
protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to
the processing of personal data. All EEA countries and Canada are
considered to have adequate protection.

### Releasing data for inspections and tenders

If personal data is requested for regulatory body inspections or for
tendering purposes the employee, where reasonably possible or practical,
will be contacted in order to gain their consent. Contents of personnel
files shall only be released to authorised personnel. HR will keep a
record of any files that are called away from the office and ensure they
are returned at the appropriate times.

### Guide to accessing information

Data processors should ensure that requests for personal data are
restricted to what is absolutely necessary for the task in hand.
Individuals should understand the reason why personal data is being
collected.

### Subject access requests

The Act grants employees/ workers/ service users/ customers the right to
have a copy of the information that the company holds about them. The
Act allows for any individual to make a \'subject access request\' to
the Company, in writing (letter or email) with a payment of £10.00 The
Company must respond promptly and fully within 40 calendar days, and
produce copies of the information it holds, where it is reasonable to do
so. For more information on how to satisfy subject access requests
please refer to Subject Access Request Policy and Procedure. Appendix 1.

All staff and contractors must be aware that

      * Individuals have the right to make a subject access request
      * Know to whom a subject access request should be addressed to within Wholistic Fostering or be able to give an individual further information on how to make a request
      * Be able to identify a request and pass it onto the right person within Wholistic Fostering for response as soon as a request is received.
      * There are some exemptions that allow organisations to withhold information.

These exemptions can apply in areas such as criminal investigation,
management planning such as promotion and transfer plans, and
negotiations. The exemptions, though, are limited in their application
even within these areas. Care must also be taken in deciding whether or
not to release information identifying \'third parties\' i.e. people,
other than the individual who has made the subject access request. Third
party information can be redacted in certain circumstances.

### Freedom of Information

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives a person the right to ask any
public body for any information they have on a particular topic, subject
to certain exceptions. The authority is obliged to respond within 20
working days. Local authority contracts entered into by Wholistic
Fostering will invariably contain a clause requiring Wholistic Fostering
to pass on any request received and may require the provision of
information to allow a response to be made. In the event a request for
information is received it must be referred to the Managing Director
immediately upon receipt to ensure it is sent to the relevant authority
within the specified timescale.

The Act also applies when submitting a tender. Certain information
submitted to public bodies can be classed as 'confidential' or
'commercially sensitive' which could prevent it being released in the
event of a future request for information. An authority will usually
supply a form for submission within the tender documents.

Correspondence shared with local or central government departments may
also fall under the scope of the Freedom of Information Act if held by a
public body. Sensitive or confidential information shared should be
clearly indicated as such.

### Environmental Information Regulations 2004

Members of the public can apply to a public body for environmental
information under the above regulations, a response to which must be
made within 20 working days. As for the Freedom of Information Act
above, Wholistic Fostering should ensure any request received is passed
to the relevant authority without delay and therefore any employee in
receipt of a request must pass it to the Managing Director immediately.

### Unauthorised disclosure/breach of data security

Organisations which process personal data must take appropriate measures
to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage to personal data. (DPA Principle
7). The measures taken by Wholistic Fostering are contained in the Data
Protection Policy and Protocol.

In the event of a breach of data security, however minor you consider it
to be, you must report this immediately to your line manager and/or the
Managing Director.

A data security breach can happen for a number of reasons:

      * Loss or theft of data or equipment on which data is stored (laptops, removable media, mobile phones)
      * Unauthorised access to data (files left open, weak passwords, equipment left unlocked/unattended)
      * Equipment failure
      * Human error, such as information being sent to the wrong recipients.
      * Unforeseen circumstances, e.g. fire or flood
      * Hacking attack
      * “Blagging” offences e.g. where information is obtained by deceiving the organisation which holds it.

However the breach has occurred, there are four important elements to
managing it. These are:

      - Containment & recovery
      - Assessment of ongoing risk
      - Notification of the breach
      - Evaluation & response

#### Containment & recovery

Data security breaches require not just an initial response and
investigation but also a recovery plan and where necessary action on
damage limitation. This may require action across the business, e.g. IT,
HR, Finance, admin and contact with external stakeholders.

The Managing Director will decide who should take the lead in
investigating the breach and ensure the appropriate resources are
available to them. They will also decide if other procedures should be
invoked, e.g. disciplinary procedures.

The Managing Director will also establish who needs to be made aware of
the breach, what action must be taken and by whom, and consider how best
to limit any damage caused by the breach to third parties or the
company.

#### Assessment of Ongoing Risk

Before deciding on what steps may be necessary beyond immediate
containment, an assessment must be made of the risks associated with
this breach. Most important is an assessment of potential adverse
consequences for individuals or organisations, how serious or
substantial these are, and how likely they are to happen again.

The following points should be considered:

      * What type of data is involved?
      * Is data still being lost, and how can further loss be prevented?
      * What has happened to the data? (how was it disclosed?)
      * How sensitive is it? (potential for misuse?)
      * If data has been lost or stolen, was it encrypted?
      * If lost or stolen, could it be used to harm individuals?
      * How many individual’s data has been affected by the breach?
      * Who are the individuals whose data has been breached? (staff,customers, etc)
      * What harm could come from the breach?
      * Are there wider consequences, including loss of business reputation?
      * How can a repetition be prevented?

#### Notification of the Breach:

Informing people and organisations that a data security breach has
occurred is an important element in Wholistic Fostering's breach
management strategy and a means of maintaining confidence in the
organisation.

The Managing Director will consider carefully who needs to be informed
about the breach and who should carry out this role. Matters to be
considered may include:

      * Any legal or contractual requirements. E.g. does a service commissioner need to be informed?
      * If equipment has been lost or stolen, do the police need to be informed?
      * Will notification help the individual? E.g. by changing a password, or cancelling a credit card?
      * If a large number of people are involved, what is the best way to communicate with them?
      * How much information about the breach should be shared with them?
      * If a large number of people are involved or there are likely to be serious consequences, the Information Commissioner may need to be informed. Further guidance is available on the ICO website at. [[https://ico.org.uk|https://ico.org.uk]]

#### Evaluation & Response:

Once the investigation has been concluded, It is important to evaluate
the causes of the breach and also the effectiveness of the company's
response to it. If the breach was caused by inadequate policies, or lack
of clear roles and responsibilities, then relevant policies and lines of
accountability should be reviewed. A further review of systems and
processes for managing personal data may also be warranted.

If human error, then disciplinary measures may need to be considered
alongside further supervision, support or training for the individual
concerned.

The learning from the data security breach should be shared with
relevant staff members in order to raise awareness of potential risks
and issues and prevent a recurrence.
