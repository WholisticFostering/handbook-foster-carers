title: Guidelines for Occasional Working from Home
---


It may be appropriate for some employees from time to time to carry out
some of their duties at home. Such arrangements may be made on the basis
of an informal agreement with their Line Manager. There are obviously
potential benefits for both the employer and the employee in such
arrangements but it is important to be aware of the implications and of
the responsibility of the parties.

It should be noted that this procedure covers occasional work from home
only and if an employee or prospective employee requests to be
designated a home-worker further advice should be sought from your HR
Adviser. For the purposes of this policy, occasionally will be defined
to represent no more than 20% of working time calculated on a monthly
basis.

# Benefits

Working from home can provide a number of benefits to both the employee
and the organisation, these include:

      * Greater flexibility in working hours
      * Higher quality work due to improved morale and fewer interruptions
      * Retention/recruitment of employees – wider pool of candidates
      * Reduced travelling times

# Opportunities and Responsibility for Working from Home

Working from home can be considered where there is no requirement for
close supervision or regular interactions in order for work to be
completed and where working away from the office would not affect the
quality of the work. Consideration must also be given to the work of the
individuals team and requirement for communication.

It is not considered appropriate to combine home based working with
dependant care. Therefore employees must be made aware that working from
home is not a substitute for making arrangements for care of dependants.

Employees must be available and contactable during agreed working hours.
Requests to work from home should be made to your line manager in the
first instance.

# Health & Safety

Under the Health and Safety at Work Act an employer has to take
reasonable steps to protect the health, safety and welfare of its staff,
Wholistic Fostering also has an agreed Code of Practice, details of
which can be found at ..... There is a duty to carry out risk assessment
in relation to work activities for all staff. This does not mean that it
will be necessary to visit the homes of every member of staff who carry
out some percentage of their work at home. For occasional work from home
it will usually be sufficient to bring to their attention possible
hazards. This can be done by issuing the document Guidelines for
Occasional Working from Home. Employees will also be responsible for
completing their own workstation assessment on their home work station,
this is required by the Display Screen Equipment Regulations, further
details can be found at ........

If you feel a member of staff is working from home more regularly please
contact your line manager for further advice.

# Stress

Working at home for some people will help reduce potential levels of
stress; they will be free from distractions and interruptions, time
usually spent travelling to the office will be eliminated along with the
stress of public transport and traffic jams. However there is also the
possibility for feelings of stress or anxiety resulting from; working
alone, long periods of home working may lead to feelings of isolation;
it may be difficult to avoid domestic crises which may lead to feelings
of guilt about backlog; ill health problems may go unnoticed and also
there is no clear beginning or end of the working day which may lead to
excessive hours. Prolonged periods of working at home are therefore not
recommended and it is essential that regular communications is
maintained.

# Legal Implications

Working from home is perfectly legal and will not affect your
residential council tax or the VAT on fuel bills. However employees must
ensure that any work equipment used at their home is covered by their
home insurance and must complete the Wholistic Fostering Loan Equipment
form.

In addition employees also need to be aware that any area of the home
used exclusively for work purposes may mean they are subject to Capital
Gains Tax.

Employees also need to be aware of the cost of using your home
telephone/fax/computer etc.

There may also be some tax implications if you have any Wholistic
Fostering property at your home and you use it for your own personal
use.

# Working from Home Guidelines for Managers

Employees can approach their line manager with a request to work from
home occasionally. Any such requests must be considered carefully,
should the request be made under the right to Request Flexible Working
the application should be considered under the Flexible Working
Procedure in conjunction with these guidelines.

# Suitable tasks

      * A high degree of written rather than manual work
      * Work is to be performed on an individual basis or with clearly defined areas of individual work which has clearly defined objectives and can be subject to performance measurement
      * Work that does not require frequent input from other colleagues

# Selection of Employees for Home Working

Not all individuals will be suitable candidates for home working and on
receiving a request the line manager should assess the employee against
the following criteria;-

      * Self motivation
      * Self reliance and discipline to work to deadlines
      * Initiative, flexibility and time management skills
      * Ability to deal with reduced social contact and isolation
      * Ability to cope with additional pressures or working at home where the demands of family life are hard to ignore

The manager should use the above characteristics to establish evidence
to support or decline an application. Copies of assessments should be
forwarded to the head office for the employees personal file.

# Agreeing a request

If a manager assesses the individual as suitable for occasional working
from home they should ensure that the employee is aware of the health
and safety issues, this can be done by issuing the employee with the
employee guidelines and ensuring that risk assessments are carried out,
a record of risk assessment should be forwarded to HR for the employees
personal file. Employees working from home are covered by the Display
Screen Regulations and must complete a risk assessment on their home
work station.

In addition the manager should agree with the employee, clear guidelines
of what is expected. These should include;-

      * Clear tasks and objectives
      * Procedure for assessing and monitoring performance and output
      * Communication arrangements including agreement of when and how the employee can be contacted, it should also be defined who may be given access to the employees home phone number
      * Any training & development needs identified as a result of the agreement
      * Details of any Wholistic Fostering equipment used at home
      * Details of how the agreement can be terminated by either side

The above should be confirmed in writing and a copy forwarded to HR for
the employees personal file.

# Occasional Working from Home Guidelines for Employees

From time to time it may be more appropriate for you to work from home
for example to complete a piece of work with the minimum of disruption.

If you wish to be considered for occasional working from home you should
approach your line manager. If you are requesting home work under your
statutory right to request Flexible Working you should apply using the
procedure set out in Flexible Working -- Guidelines for staff, details
are available from the HR.

If your request is successful then your line manager will provide you
with an agreement setting out the terms of your agreement. In addition
you also need to follow the general principles as set out below.

# Security

Employees must take care to ensure the security of work in their home,
this will include;

      * Security and confidentiality of Wholistic Fostering equipment and information
      * No access of friends and family to work
      * Protection of home computers and their links, employees must ensure that work moved by disk does not transfer viruses to Wholistic Fostering machines

# Health and Safety

For occasional working from home it is not necessary for the Wholistic
Fostering to visit your home however you will be required to familiarise
yourself with the potential hazards which are outlined below.

# Display Screen Equipment

If you do work at home using a computer the Display Screen Equipment
Regulations apply and you should undertake an assessment of your
workstation to make sure it does not present any health and safety
hazards.

# Electrical and Other Work Equipment

Employees are responsible for the safety of the wiring/electricity
circuit in their homes but should complete the Visual Inspection list
for Electrical Equipment. In addition, it is important to ensure that
any electrical equipment, for example laptop computers provided for work
at home is safe and regularly maintained and employees should bring in
such equipment for checking in accordance with maintenance agreements
and should also ensure that any personal equipment used is also
maintained regularly.

# Hazardous Substances

Employees are prohibited from taking hazardous substances from the work
place to home.
