title: Foster Carer Retention Policy & Procedure
---


Wholistic Fostering is committed to valuing and retaining its Foster
Carers. This is essential to both Carers and the organisation as it
improves and develops Carer's individual expertise and in so doing helps
improve the levels of services the Agency can offer and also increases
standards. Foster Carers are essential to the operation of the Agency.

There are a great number of agencies available to Carers to choose from
and quality of support Carers receive is essential to Carer retention.
The negative aspects of losing experienced Carers are the associated
recruitment and training costs.

Although the Agency as a whole has a clear duty in setting standards and
recognising the valuable work undertaken by Carers it is essential for
SSWs to recognise their roles and provide continuous support to sustain
their Carers.

As the front line of the service the quality of care provided by Foster
Carers is frequently directly linked to the quality of support they
receive from their SSWs and agency.

It is also important to think about the perceptions that staff and
Carers may have within an Agency. Wholistic Fostering will actively
promote an environment where staff and Carers are viewed and seen as
working as part of the same team with a common purpose e.g. SSWs and
Carers will be expected to attend training events together.

## Retention in Practice

Everything that any person does within the Agency can have a knock on
effect to another person e.g. not answering the phone or delays in
returning calls will frustrate the caller, this in turn may leave an
issue unresolved or an incident unreported. Staff and Carers alike must
be aware of the need for attention to detail and the expectation of high
quality care.

We want Carers to feel that they have a genuine say in the running of
the Agency that they can influence positive change (e.g. Carer rep) and
they feel part of a professional team of people offering a good care
service.

If Carers are well supported, recognised for the task they undertake,
have regular placement and are properly rewarded the numbers of Carers
wishing to leave the Agency will be kept to a minimum.

## Reasons Why Carers Leave Agencies

The following is a list of reasons why carers may leave an agency. They
are not ranked in any order as some issues are more important to an
individual than others, or it may not be any one issue on its own, but a
number of factors.

      * Few or no placements
      * Poor support
      * Limited training opportunities
      * Poor quality supervision or no supervision at all
      * Infrequent visits by SSWs
      * Developmental needs not being meet
      * Attractive fees and allowances offered by other agencies
      * Persuasion by Local Authorities to transfer
      * Phone calls not being returned and poor communication

Key Factors - Carer Retention

      * Have a clear set of standards and policies and making these clear from the first contact.
      * Encourage transparency and an open communication , ‘No secrets’ culture
      * Regular visits and supervision as required
      * Providing respite and outreach support as required
      * Recruiting Carers who have the skills and facilities which the Agency can utilise in making the right placements
      * Spot early signs of placement breakdown and try to solve problems whilst they remain small and before they escalate.
      * Provide a duty call advice service and support for all Carers 24/7
      * Help the carers form meaningful attachments with the young people.
      * Having relevant and enjoyable training plans and courses and maintain a training and supervision culture at all times
      * Ensuring good matching of child’s needs to carer’s skills, abilities and experiences.
      * To facilitate regular informal and formal peer group meetings and social opportunities
      * Carer support groups meeting regularly and led by Carer’s SSW or preferably by Carers
      * Giving positive feedback and praise when deserve and recognising commitment and effort through annual reviews.
      * Small tokens, gifts and cards expressing appreciation by staff and management to acknowledge extra efforts and satisfactory conclusion of difficult pieces of work
      * To have a “Carer representative” be part of the main management meetings on a periodic basis.
      * Provide regular communications to Carers by way of letters, fliers, information updates, websites, etc.
      * All queries and phone calls are responded to promptly
      * Complaints are listened too and constructively managed at the lowest level possible.
      * Being realistic about the whole fostering task
      * Being more prescriptive about a Carer’s introduction to fostering and considering where possible short term respite placements prior to long term placements. Ensuring the Carer can cope with each level of behaviour presented before offering them greater challenges.
      * Ensuring that Carers understand how to use the complaints procedures and complaints are dealt with promptly as the lowest possible level
      * Good levels of financial support and reward with regular correct, on time payments

## Management Committee

A key role of the management committee is to ensure that the service
levels and standards of the Agency are maintained. To ensure the
Directors of the Agency are in touch with the needs of the Carers; a
Carers representative will be elected to sit on the committee to enable
Carers to provide direct feedback to the partners on issues which either
concerns them or which they feel positive about.

## Resignation of Carers

There are many reasons why Carers resign. Wholistic Fostering believe
that if Foster Carers feel they are valued and supported the number of
resignations will be kept to a minimum. It is not in the Agency's
interest to lose Carers or have an excess of resignations. Therefore we
want Carers to truly feel they are part of the Agency and that they can
affect positive change.

Not all Carer resignations are due to negative reasons and this must be
recognised e.g. Carers may resign due to a change in personal
circumstances or retirement.

## Background Information

All resignations will be dealt with on their own merits. However, no
Carer will be allowed to resign if there are concerns about their
practices until these have been fully investigated. In these
circumstances the Carers will be made aware of the Agency's position at
the earliest opportunity.

Every effort must be made to explore the reason for the resignation. As
stated earlier it may just be a change in circumstances, but there may
be a reason for the resignation which can be addressed. Experience has
shown that some Carers are unwilling to express their concerns for fear
of being ostracised. Many reasons why Carers resign can be quickly and
effectively dealt with (See Carers Retention Policy).

## Carers

The underlying principle of this policy is that Carers have a right to
choice and a right to resign. This policy is also in line with current
legislative requirements.

Current legislation does not say much on the resignation process except
that to resign a Carer puts their resignation in writing to their Agency
and on the 29th day after their resignation has been received they are
no longer that Agency's Carer.

Therefore where there are genuine concerns about standards and practice
the Carer's resignation must be responded to without delay, usually
within 7 days.

Where there are children in placement the matter is slightly more
complex and the children's well being must be taken into consideration.
In these circumstances the Fostering Networks Protocol for Transferring
Carers will be used as guidance.

However, it must be remembered that this document has no legal standing
and each situation may be slightly different depending on circumstances.

## Exit Interviews

When a notice to resign is received an exit interview will be arranged.
This is standard practice and is part of the Agency's quality assurance
process i.e. if we are able to identify the reason for Carer
resignations, we can improve services to reduce their occurrences. The
interview will be conducted by a person who does not normally support
the Carer. A written report will be made of the interview and
distributed to all parties concerned.
