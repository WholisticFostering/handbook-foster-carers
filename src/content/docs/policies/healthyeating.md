title: HEALTHY EATING POLICY
---


## Nutrition

Nutrition is a significant factor in the growth, development and overall
functioning of a child. Good nutrition provides the energy and nutrients
essential to sustain life and promotes physical, emotional and cognitive
development. The development of healthy eating practices and physical
activity can prevent disease and support a lifetime of good health. Good
nutrition is critical to optimizing each child's potential for success.
Meeting nutritional requirements throughout childhood is essential to
full intellectual development. Research documents tell us that under
nutrition impacts on children's behaviour, performance and overall
quality of development. Children require sufficient energy and essential
nutrients each day to concentrate on accomplished learning tasks. Even
mild and under nutrition and short term hunger are barriers to learning.
Meals and snacks served should meet children's nutrition needs, provide
models of healthy eating patterns, and help children establish good
eating patterns at an early age.

## Aim

To work in partnership with families and other professionals to support
children in developing healthy eating practices which will become
embedded for life.

## Objectives

      * To provide children with positive healthy eating experiences in order to promote their well being.
      * To respect the different dietary, cultural, religious and health needs of all our children.
      * To encourage children to develop positive attitudes towards food.
      * To promote an understanding of a balanced diet in which some foods play a greater role than others.
      * To develop children’s understanding of the importance of the social context in which eating takes place.
      * To raise awareness with children, in developing a positive approach to food, nutrition and oral education.
      * To encourage responsibility and accountability of all Foster Parents and staff in offering healthy choices to children.

## The Importance of Nutrition for Children and Young People

A nutritionally balanced diet is important in childhood to ensure
optimum development at a time of rapid growth. A balanced diet in
childhood is not only important for growth but for learning and
promoting positive habits towards healthy eating. An inadequate or
unbalanced nutritional intake may not only affect growth and development
in childhood but may also impact on health problems, such as heart
disease and obesity in later life. It is the types and varieties of food
eaten at this time that ensure nutrient requirements are met and that
the diet is nutritionally balanced. Children's diet must include an
appropriate intake of foods from the four main food groups:

      * Bread, other cereals and potatoes
      * Fruit and vegetables
      * Milk and dairy foods
      * Meat, fish and alternatives

## Being Healthy

      * Eat breakfast every day
      * Eat fruit and vegetables daily
      * Choose snacks that will provide nutrients to compliment meals
      * Avoid snacks and drinks with a high sugar content between meals
      * Drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated
      * Be physically active every day
      * Brush teeth twice a day and visit your dentist regularly

## Water

All staff should support the children in recognising that they need to
drink water when they are thirsty, hot or tired, or feeling unwell.

Special dietary needs and food allergies

All staff and Foster Parents should be sensitive to the catering needs
of children with specific dietary needs, including religious
considerations.

## Social skills

Meals can be times of pleasant social sharing. Opportunities for foster
parents to eat and drink together. This also provides an opportunity for
Children and young people to learn good social skills and behaviour
associated with eating and drinking.

Festivals and celebrations

Wholistic Fostering recognize and will encourage their foster parents to
celebrate festivals. Festivals can provide a valuable opportunity for
children and young people to experience diversity from a wide range of
cultures and nationalities and the contribution they make to the variety
of foods eaten in Britain today.
