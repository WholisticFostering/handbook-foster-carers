lastUpdated: 2025-06-30

## 📅 Review Frequency

All foster carers are reviewed at least once a year. The **first annual
review** is presented to the [Fostering Panel](policies/fostering_panel)
within 12 months of approval.

Reviews may also be held sooner if there are significant changes in the
carer\'s household, health, or fostering circumstances -- or if concerns
or allegations arise.

Regular [supervision](policies/support_supervision) and informal
feedback happen throughout the year.

## 🗣️ Before the Review

Your Supervising Social Worker gathers key information, including:

-   Placements you\'ve had
-   Feedback from children, their social workers, and your household
-   Training, complaints, or allegations
-   Any changes in checks (e.g. DBS, health)

You and your household are invited to complete a self-review form. All
paperwork is submitted 2 weeks before the review meeting.

## 🏠 The Review Meeting

Held in your home, this meeting includes:

-   You (and your partner, if applicable)
-   Your Supervising Social Worker
-   A Reviewing Officer

It covers:

-   Your fostering work and safe caring practice
-   Any updates to your Fire Plan, Health & Safety, or pets risk
    assessment
-   Training completed or needed
-   Support needs
-   Any changes in approval category

A report and recommendation are written, shared with you for comments,
and added to your file. A date for the next review is set.

## 📝 Panel Presentation

Your **first review** must go to Panel. Other reviews may go if:

-   There are major changes in your approval
-   Concerns have been raised
-   Termination is being considered

Panel members receive the full review report and supporting documents.
You may attend with a supporter and provide written comments. The
Panel\'s recommendation goes to the Agency Decision Maker (ADM), who
makes the final decision.

You'll be informed in writing of the outcome within 5 working days.

## ❌ Termination of Approval

Approval may end due to:

-   Resignation -- by written notice, effective after 28 days
-   Review outcome -- if you're no longer considered suitable

In these cases:

-   You'll be notified in writing
-   The ADM's decision includes reasons and the date of termination
-   You have 28 days to:
    1.  Make representations to the agency
    2.  Request a review by the **Independent Review Mechanism (IRM)**
        (unless disqualified under Regulation 26(8))

Where relevant, we will inform:

-   The child's placing authority
-   Ofsted
-   The Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO)
-   The Disclosure & Barring Service (if applicable)

## 🔁 DBS & Health Updates

-   **DBS checks** are updated every 3 years for anyone aged 18+ in the
    home.
-   **Health declarations** are also reviewed every 3 years.

If concerns arise from these, an immediate review may be triggered.

## 🗃️ Record Keeping

We keep foster carer files for **at least 10 years** after approval
ends. If your approval ends, we update the Register of Foster Carers and
your Foster Care Agreement if needed.
