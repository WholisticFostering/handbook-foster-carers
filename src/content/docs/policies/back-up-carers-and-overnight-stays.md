## Overnight Stays

\
Respite care is regarded by Wholistic Fostering as any relief care that
includes overnight stays. An exception to this, as outlined in the
Overnight stays, is when a child or young person has occasional
overnight stays or 'sleep-overs' at a friend's house.

The overnight stay should not be used to circumvent the need for those
providing respite care for Foster Parents to undergo due assessment by
Wholistic Fostering.

## Babysitting

## 

## 

Respite care differs from babysitting in that babysitting usually takes
place in the foster home and would not normally involve overnight care.
If, exceptionally, it does involve overnight care, then this can only be
for a maximum of 24 hrs and cannot take place without full agreement
first being obtained from Wholistic Fostering.

## Need to Access Respite

## 

Wholistic Fostering recognises that access to respite care can be a key
factor in promoting placement stability both in relation to long and
short term fostering. Whilst fostering can be very rewarding, equally it
can be a particularly demanding and sometimes stressful occupation. Not
only can it be so for foster parents themselves but also sometimes for
the children of foster parents.

Wholistic Fostering recognises Foster parents are asked to provide the
experience of a 'normal family life' for the children they foster and
that they take respite whilst a child or children are in placement.
However, Wholistic Fostering recognises that foster parents are often
caring for children whose previous life experiences have been anything
other than ordinary and whose resulting needs are such that their foster
parents are required to utilise considerable personal resources in order
to meet those needs.

Wholistic Fostering therefore accepts that there may be occasions when
Foster parents may need to take some 'time out' from fostering whilst a
child or children are in placement in order to recharge themselves, so
enabling them to continue with a particular placement or placements.

However, where at all possible, the agency believes that it is
preferable for Foster parents to take respite between having a child or
children in placement, as this would avoid causing disruption to
children. When this is not possible, for example in relation to long
term placements, then Wholistic fostering will endeavour to provide
their foster parent with respite by providing an alternative placement
for the child or children in the foster parent's care.

## Your Respite Explained

## 

## 

## 

Respite will be provided by the Wholistic Fostering for up to a maximum
of two weeks for every 52 weeks a child is in placement. This would be
on a pro rata basis. For example, if a foster parent has had a child in
placement for only 6 month of the year and no other child in placement
for the rest of the year, then that foster parent would only be able to
have paid respite for up to a maximum of one week.

## Careful Consideration When Requesting Respite

## 

## 

When considering taking respite when a child or children are in
placement, a careful balance needs to be struck between why respite is
needed at that time and the general situation of the child in placement.

Examples of significant events:

      * Disruption with school, family, contact etc
      * bereavement
      * When a child or young person has been recently placed.

In such circumstances Wholistic fostering will in consultation with the
Foster parent and the Responsible Local Authority, look to see if it
would be better to support the foster parent in other ways during that
period.

The following factors also need to be borne in mind when considering
respite:\
It is important to avoid arranging respite when there is a significant
event or celebration due to take place in the fostering household, so
excluding a child.

Only in exceptional circumstances will the agency agree to respite if
this meant that a child could not attend school.

It is important to avoid differentiating between children in the foster
home by having a particular child or children going on respite whilst
another child or children remain in the home. However, the agency
recognised that especially for those Foster parents who have children of
their own, this may not always be achievable.

Whilst respite might be needed as a consequence of a child's behaviour,
it should not be presented as a punishment to the child - to do so would
not only be unfair to the child but also on those providing the respite.

Where there is more than one child in placement, and the respite is
needed as a consequence of the behaviour of a particular child, then it
should not be assumed that every other child in placement should also go
on respite at that time. Consideration always needs to be given to the
individual needs of each child in placement.

## Arrangement of Respite

\
All respite care has to be arranged through Wholistic Fostering and can
only be provided by individuals whom the agency has assessed as suitable
to provide respite care.

\
Wholistic Fostering encourages a team ethos amongst Foster parents
whereby Foster parents will be open to providing respite for other
foster parents when they are in a position to do so.

## Requesting Respite

\
Respite requests should be made at least 6 weeks in advance of the
allocated date. The only exception to this would be in the case of an
emergency.

The respite notice period is required in order to allow enough time to

      * idenfity appropriate provision
      * consult with all concerned
      * undertake introductions and exchange of information

Wholistic Fostering will endeavour to make respite care available for
foster parents. However Foster parents must bear in mind that this is a
very much dependent on appropriate provision being available.

We would like to highlight that making a request does not in itself
guarantee that respite provision will be made available.
