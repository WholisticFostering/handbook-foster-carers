title: 📋 Respite, Backup Carers & Overnight Stays Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-06-18

Wholistic Fostering supports foster carers by offering respite care and
guidance on overnight stays, while ensuring continuity, stability, and
emotional security for children in placement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌙 Overnight Stays (Social)

Occasional overnight stays (e.g. sleepovers at a friend's) are
encouraged where appropriate as part of normal family life.

-   Must be discussed with the child\'s social worker
-   Consent should be recorded in the [Placement
    Plan](procedures/placement-plans)
-   Must not be used to avoid the formal respite process

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👶 Babysitting vs Respite

\* **Babysitting**: Short-term care (no overnight), usually in the
foster home by a trusted adult. \* **Respite**: Any care involving an
**overnight stay**, or planned time out for foster carers.

Even if an overnight babysit is short (e.g. one night), it must be
**pre-approved by Wholistic Fostering**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 When Respite is Needed

Fostering can be both rewarding and demanding. Wholistic Fostering
recognises carers may need breaks to:

-   Recharge during long-term placements
-   Maintain family wellbeing
-   Promote placement stability

Where possible, carers are encouraged to take breaks **between
placements** to avoid disruption. When that's not feasible, the agency
will try to arrange temporary alternative care for the child(ren).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕒 Respite Entitlement

Foster carers are entitled to up to **2 weeks' respite per 52 weeks** of
care, pro-rata.

Example: If a child is placed for 6 months in a year → carer may request
**up to 1 week** of respite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚖️ Considering Respite Carefully

Respite should always consider the child's current situation and
emotional needs. Avoid scheduling during:

-   Major family events (e.g. birthdays, holidays)
-   Times of distress or change (e.g. bereavement, recent placement,
    school disruption)

Important points:

-   Respite must not be used as a **punishment**
-   If one child's behaviour leads to respite, others should not
    automatically be included
-   Try to avoid situations where only one child is sent on respite
    while others remain at home (if avoidable)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧾 Arranging Respite

All respite placements must:

-   Be arranged through Wholistic Fostering
-   Be delivered by **approved and assessed carers**
-   Be logged in the child's [Placement
    Plan](procedures/placement-plans)

We encourage foster carers to support each other where possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📅 How to Request Respite

Respite requests should be made **at least 6 weeks in advance**, unless
in an emergency.

This allows time to:

-   Identify suitable carers
-   Complete introductions and information sharing
-   Obtain agreement from all parties

Please note:

> A request does **not guarantee** availability --- this depends on
> provision at the time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **In Summary** Respite is a support tool --- not a fallback or a
right in all circumstances. We aim to offer it fairly, flexibly, and in
a way that upholds the best interests of the child.
