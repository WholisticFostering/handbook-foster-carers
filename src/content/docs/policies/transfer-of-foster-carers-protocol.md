title: Transfer of Foster Carers Protocol
---

This protocol has been developed and is approved by the Fostering Network,
the joint forum of independent fostering providers and the ADCS taking
account of legislative changes and feedback from members on the previous
protocol. It recommends the good practice guidelines to be followed when
a foster carer wishes to transfer from one fostering service to another.
It is not intended to cover block transfers of carers from one fostering
service to another (e.g. following the award of a service contract to a
different service).\</font\>

      * 

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>To
ensure that foster carers are not pressurised into changing their

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/
;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Fostering services should not approach individual
foster carers with a view to recruiting them without the knowledge of
their current fostering service. Neither should a fostering service
begin an assessment on foster carers who have approached them with a
view to transferring from another service without the knowledge of that
service.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>It is
recognised, however, that there will be circumstances when it is
appropriate for foster carers to have initial discussions with a new
fostering service before agreeing to begin an assessment and before the
foster carer informs their current fostering service.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Foster
carers should not be approached to explore the possibility of their
application for a legal order in respect of a child which would mean
that they no longer fostered that child (e.g. Residence, Special
Guardianship, Adoption) without the knowledge of the fostering
service.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Foster
carers should not be required to change fostering service in order to
secure agreement to a plan for a child.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/

placement\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>The
foster carer should generally inform their current fostering service in
writing that they are considering a move to another fostering service.
It is recognised, however, that there will be circumstances when it is
appropriate for foster carers to have initial discussions with a new
fostering service before agreeing to begin an assessment and before the
foster carer informs their current fostering service.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>The
recruiting fostering service may begin an assessment once this has been
received by the current service. As a matter of good practice, the new
service should ensure that the current service has received this
notification.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Once
the assessment has been completed and the recruiting service informs the
foster carer that they intend to approve them as a foster carer, the
foster carer should give written notice of resignation to their current
service.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>The
fostering regulations state that an approval will be terminated 28 days
from a written notice of resignation being received from a foster carer
(The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011, Reg 28 (13); The
Fostering Services (Wales) Regulations 2003 Reg. 29(11)). The foster
carer must be approved by the fostering service to which they are
transferring with effect from the date that their previous approval
ends.\</font\>

;;#000000;;#ffffff\>2\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>It
follows that the fostering panel of the new service must make a
recommendation regarding their approval whilst they are still approved
by their original fostering service. If the decision maker for the new
service were to delay a decision to give approval until the date that
the foster carer's previous approval ended, this would meet the
requirements of the regulations although may not comply with Standard
14.9 whereby a decision should be made within seven working days of
receipt of the panel recommendation.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Any
failure to follow the detail of the standard would need to be
justifiable against the stated outcome that 'the fostering panel and
decision maker make timely, quality and appropriate
recommendations/decisions in line with the overriding objective to
promote the welfare of children in foster care'.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>It is
recommended that the foster carer submits their resignation to their
current service, either by hand or by recorded delivery postal service,
to ensure that the date the resignation is received by the current
service, and thus the date of termination of the current registration,
is known by all parties.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>The
recruiting service should ensure that they do not approve the foster
carer before the date upon which the resignation takes effect. The
termination of the foster carer's approval takes place automatically 28
days following the receipt of the written notice of resignation and
requires no action by the current agency, or their panel, to take
effect. It is good practice however for the current service to conduct
an exit interview, where appropriate, and for the information from this
to be presented to the service's panel for information and monitoring
purposes.\</font\>

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>A
foster carer's assessment report is the property of the service which
produced it. However, foster carers have the right to almost all the
information that is in the report (see The Fostering Network's guidance
on confidentiality of information for further details). The recruiting
service may ask the foster carer or their current fostering service if
they can see a copy of the foster carer's assessment report. If the
existing service agrees to share information from its own assessment of
the foster carers, it may not be necessary for the new fostering service
to collect again all of the information required for the new
assessment.\</font\>

provider can take account of information obtained by the existing

previous employer or ex-partner who was interviewed in the past to
verify facts and where no further information is required. \[5.30,

\<font 11.000000pt font-family: \'TTE8t00\'/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff\>It is
good practice for foster carers to have a copy of their assessment
report minus any confidential information from third parties. Under the
Data Protection Act 1998, they are entitled to access the information.
However, foster carers may not have the right to give this report to the
recruiting agency as the current fostering service may hold intellectual
property rights over the report. Infringing intellectual property rights
could expose a foster carer to civil or criminal proceedings.\</font\>

have completed the Standards and will be able to provide the new service

new service, they will be required to become familiar with the new
policies and procedures of the service, even if they have previously

which ensures their needs will be adequately met and a fee to the foster
carer, not less than they were receiving previously. In addition, the
agency management fee may be negotiated. If the recruiting service
provider has been accepted by the local authority as part of an
