POLICY & GUIDANCE

## Purpose of Lone worker Guidelines

\
The purpose of these guidelines is to provide managers and employees
with guidance for employees and others who may be "lone workers" and the
practical steps to be taken to keep people safe when they are at work
whether on Wholistic Fostering premises, shared offices or elsewhere in
the community. People who work alone should not be at any greater risk
than others.

## Equality Statement

\
This policy applies equally to all employees, as above, regardless of
their disability,gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. Care will
be taken to ensure that no traditionally excluded groups are adversely
impacted in implementing this policy.

When is a worker a lone worker?

## 

\
A 'Lone Worker' is any person whose work involves either brief or a
large portion of their time in situations where there is no close,
frequent or regular involvement with other workers or supervision.\
Who is a lone worker?

      * • Where only one person is in the premises, it could be an administrator in an office working early or late, a single person in a workshop, kiosk or shop or someone working at home. People who work outside of normal office hours, cleaners, security or maintenance workers.
      * • Service workers, social workers, parking attendants pest control workers, drivers,teachers and other workers who visit commercial or domestic premises.
      * • Delegated day to day responsibility for ensuring the day to day management for health,safety and welfare within their areas.
      * • Responsible to the directors for ensuring that safe working conditions are maintained for all employees, visitors, members of the public, and contractors within their respective business units and schools for the areas they control.
      * • Responsible for their own health and safety and that of their colleagues and members of the public who may be by their work activities.Health and safety team.<nowiki>\</nowiki> • Will actively support the agency and its employees in meeting their health and safety obligations by producing effective policies, procedures and general guidance.

## Can workers legally work alone safely?

There is no general reason why people can not work by themselves. The
answer to this question will be based on the outcome of your risk
assessment, the environment and conditions that apply. An example of a
high risk activity which would require at least one other person to be
present to provide assistance in the case of an emergency arising:\
Example include:\
• Visiting clients or customers at home with a known history of violence
or aggression

## Management arrangements

## 

Managers need to ensure that their employees remain healthy and safe
whilst at work; this includes working in buildings or remote or isolated
areas. Wholistic Fostering has developed procedures to support people
whilst working alone, it is part of a manager's role to ensure that the
procedures are adapted to suit their areas and that their employees are
provided with suitable and sufficient training and information on these
procedures.The basis for developing any procedure is through carrying
out a thorough risk assessment and then applying the findings to develop
suitable safe working practices.

## Risk Assessment

\
The procedure for carrying out risk assessments is no different from the
normal work place assessment process. i.e.\
1. Identify the hazards\
2. Decide who can be harmed and how\
3. Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions\
4. Record your findings and implement them\
5. Monitor and update them as necessary\
1. The Hazards (things with the potential to cause harm) see Hazards.

Whilst the hazards are similar to everyday working situations they may
be exacerbated by the fact that a person is alone and perhaps not in the
immediate vicinity of aide and assistance.e.g.

• Abusive customers or clients\
• Animal attacks\
• Cash handling\
• Defective vehicles\
• Driving and/or road rage\
• Electric shocks\
• Exposure to chemicals or biological agents\
• Faulty equipment\
• Fire\
• Manual handling heavy or unwieldy loads\
• Noise\
• Poor or lack of training\
• Pregnant or young workers\
• Remoteness or isolation\
• Slips, trips or falls\
• Sudden illness rendering the worker unable to summon help\
• Violent clients, members of the public or other staff.\
• Working at height\
• Working in confined spaces\
• Working over or near water

## Who can be harmed?

\
Employees or other people who may potentially be injured or ill as a
result of work being carried out. In particular you should consider
vulnerable groups such as those with special needs, young or pregnant
workers and those called upon to rescue or give aid to injured people.

Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions. In consultation with
employees and their representatives decide on the level of risk posed by
the situation and whether or not extra precautions are required or
whether or not the job can be\
undertaken safely by a single person. Depending on the results you may
need to introduce new precautions, safe working practices or provide
personal protective equipment\
e.g.\
Access to communications\
Automatic warning devices\
First aid equipment & training\
Further specialist training\
Introducing a "buddy system"\
Lifting equipment\
Maintenance checks on equipment and vehicles\
Out of office recording procedures\
Periodic supervisory checks\
Personal alarms\
Regular supervisory meetings\
Safe working practices\
Security staff

## Record your findings & implement them

Keep records of the significant findings of your risk assessments.
Ensure people are informed of the results and any new safe working
practices. Records of risk assessments should be retained for as long as
they are effective or superseded. In the majority of cases they should
be held for the minimum of one year.

## Monitor and update findings as necessary

Risk assessments and the outcomes will be monitored as often as required
to ensure they remain effective. They should be reviewed or updated when
there are major changes to the organisation, work practice or working
environment. Should an accident or incident occur which indicates a
failure of the precautions that have been developed then they should be
reviewed immediately, all risk assessments should be reviewed at least
annually?

## High risk situations

\
Where a risk assessment identifies that lone working poses a high risk
to a lone worker, lone working should be avoided or arrangements for
providing assistance and support put in place. Where a lone worker is
working at another employer's workplace similar arrangements will apply.
As far as reasonably practical employers should co-operate with one
another on the measures to be taken to ensure the Health and Safety of
their employees.

## Home visits or out of office visits

\
It is essential that you leave a daily diary or record of visits and
movements with your line manager or a nominated person. Everyone who
visits people at home or in the community must have their vehicle
details,\
i.e. registration number, make of vehicle and colour and insurance
recorded by their line manager. These details should be held securely
but accessible in case an emergency arises. Managers are to ensure these
details are kept up to date. In the event that a person does not report
in after finishing a visit the manager or nominated person should
instigate a contact procedure, i.e. mobile phone call, if there is still
no contact a senior manager should be informed and a decision taken
whether to go directly to the last known address or alert the police.

## Dealing with animals

\
If there are animals known to be at a property you have to visit it is
recommended that the occupants are contacted (if possible), to secure
the animals(s) before you arrive.

## Communications

\
Mobile phones should always be kept fully charged and spare batteries
made held available for use.Ifnot personal mobile phones employees must
be shown how to use them effectively. Mobile phones should not be relied
on as the only protective measure, they provide a degree of comfort and
support to those working alone in the community. Remember to check
signal strength and make sure you have left a record of your visit with
your line manager or nominated person.

## Information and Training

\
Employees and others will be provided with the necessary information,
training and supervision, to support them in the recognition of hazards
and appreciation of the risks associated with working alone (and in any
other working environment) and the precautions or safe working practices
they should be using. Employees are required to follow the safe working
practices which will include contact arrangements, the provision of
first aid, keeping safe in lone working situations, and emergency
procedures. Line managers are responsible for ensuring that their
employees attend\
the appropriate training. Everyone should remember that their own
personal safety should be a priority they should not get involved in any
situation that is escalating or where there are concerns that it might
result in violence. If they cannot avoid it, intervals should make sure
they have a way out. If an individual's personal safety is compromised
they should:\
• Get out of the situation\
• Summon help\
• Call security or the police

Where people are involved in an incident where they felt threatened or
intimidated they should\
complete an accident report. Then report it to their line manager. Line
managers will take action and provide support as necessary. Wholistic
Fostering will support individual staff members in line with the zero
tolerance stance towards violence and aggression towards its employees.

## Working from home

Whilst employees are working from home they have the same level of
support and assistance as they would if they were working from an
office. Line managers should ensure that suitable risk assessments are
completed prior to people working from home and consider the additional
measures which may need to be taken to keep the employee safe and\
healthy. These measures would include considering the security of the
home e.g. keeping doors locked when alone, and not giving out home
addresses or phone numbers to clients or customers and any other
equipment and training which may be required.

## Reception areas

Building managers should ensure all buildings have a local procedure for
management of lone working situations and staff are provided with
instruction and training.

## Hazards

\
The following list is not designed to be comprehensive but a guide to
the hazards which may exist\
in any working environment. It is not specific to lone working which may
heighten the risk when\
taken into consideration. You should consult with your employees and
their representatives to get\
an all round view of the work undertaken and known hazards.\
• Abusive customers or clients\
• Animal attacks\
• Cash handling\
• Confined spaces\
• Defective vehicles\
• Driving or road rage\
• Drowning\
• Electric shocks\
• Exposure to chemicals or biological agents\
• Faulty equipment\
• Fire/explosions\
• Highway working\
• Inappropriate or no personal protective equipment provided\
• Infection\
• Manual handling -- especially heavy or unwieldy loads\
• Noise\
• Physical attack\
• Poisoning\
• Poor illumination\
• Poor or lack of training\
• Pregnant or young workers\
• Remoteness or isolation\
• Road traffic accidents\
• Slips, trips and falls\
• Sudden illness rendering the worker unable to summon help\
• Tools and machinery\
• Unknown area or workplace\
• Use of vehicles\
• Vehicle movements\
• Verbal abuse\
• Vibration\
• Violent clients, members of the public or other staff.\
• Working at height

Each hazard should be suitably assessed to the threat or risk it poses
to employees and others who could be affected by the nature of the work
being undertaken. Where the risk is not being controlled to the lowest
reasonably practicable level, new precautions must be devised and
implemented.
