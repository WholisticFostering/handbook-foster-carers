## ✅ Purpose

The Foster Carers Handbook is a key document we provide to every
approved foster carer. It brings together clear, practical guidance on
the expectations, procedures, and support available to carers in their
role with Wholistic Fostering.

It is part of our commitment to supporting carers with consistent,
accessible information in line with National Minimum Standard **21.10**.

## 🧾 What's Included

The Handbook includes:

-   Our expectations of foster carers
-   Day-to-day practice guidance
-   Support available to carers
-   Training and development
-   Financial arrangements
-   Health, safety and safeguarding
-   Key agency contacts and escalation routes

It also reflects other policy areas such as:

-   [Complaints and Representations](policies/complaints)
-   [🌍 Equality, Diversity & Inclusion
    (EDI)](policies/equality_diversity_inclusion)
-   [Contact Arrangements](policies/contact)
-   [Standards of Care](policies/standards_of_care)

## 📥 Access and Updates

All carers receive a copy of the handbook at approval, and it is:

-   Reviewed **annually** by the Registered Manager
-   Updated when policy or regulatory changes occur
-   Re-issued or highlighted when changes are made

Carers will be notified of updates by email, newsletter, or in
supervision.

## 📌 Format

The handbook is available in digital format (PDF) and on request as a
printed copy. It is written in plain English and designed to be easy to
navigate.

## 🔒 Compliance

Providing and updating the handbook ensures we comply with:

-   **NMS 21.10** -- ensuring foster carers have access to policies and
    guidance
-   **The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011**
-   Good practice guidance from the Fostering Network

## 🧡 Our Commitment

Wholistic Fostering believes confident, well-informed carers make the
best difference for children. The handbook is one of the ways we make
sure every carer feels prepared, empowered and supported throughout
their fostering journey.
