## An Applicants Guide

## What is a fostering panel?

Panels were created to meet the requirements of the Fostering Service
Regulations 2002. Under these regulations, all fostering service
providers have to set up a Panel to consider and make recommendations
relating to applications from prospective foster carers.

## What does a fostering panel do?

The Panel reviews the information and evidence in the report your
supervising social worker writes for you when you apply to become a
foster carer.

The Panel then makes a decision whether or not to recommend you as a
foster carer to your fostering agency.

## Before Panel

Copies of relevant reports and other documents to do with your
application are forwarded to the Panel members so that they can read
them before the Panel meeting. Members may request further information
at this stage if they need any clarification.

## Can you attend Panel?

Yes.

You and your social worker will receive an invitation from the
Chairperson. The panel likes you to be as fully involved as possible and
welcomes the opportunity to meet you. Many applicants find it useful to
attend panel to answer any questions that arise and to fill in any gaps
straight away.

## What happens at Panel?

You and your social worker will be invited to attend Panel.

If you decide to attend, the Chairperson will meet with you on your own
before you meet the full Panel to join in the discussion.

The Panel will ask you questions and you will have an opportunity to ask
questions of your own.

Your social worker will then take you to a waiting room and will rejoin
the Panel to hear final discussions.

When a conclusion has been reached, the Chairperson will leave the
meeting to join you and tell you of the Panel's recommendation.

## After Panel

A copy of the Panel minutes is forwarded with the panel\'s
recommendation to a senior manager at the fostering agency which dealt
with your application.

This senior manager is referred to as the Agency Decision Maker. It is
that person who will make the final decision as to whether you become
approved as a foster carer.

You will be sent written confirmation of the agency's decision.

### What happens if you are not approved?

You can write to the Agency Decision Maker within 28 days to make an
appeal and have your application reviewed. Your social worker will
explain the appeals procedure to you.

Once additional questions have been asked and other points clarified,
your report is returned to Panel for a revised recommendation.

If you are not approved after resubmitting your report for a second
time, we cannot take your application further.

## Who\'s on the Panel?

A Panel is made up of:

-   Panel Chairperson and Vice Chairperson
-   Founder / Director of Independent Fostering Agency
