title: Representations / Independent Review Procedure
---


If a decision is made to refuse an application, the applicant will be
advised that if he or she wishes to challenge the decision, applicants
should be advised of their right to submit representations within 28
days of the date of the written notice of the decision to the manager.
In addition, as an alternative, they may exercise the right to apply to
the Secretary of State to request a review of the decision by an
Independent Review Panel. Any such application must be made in writing
within 28 days of the decision and supported by reasons.

The only circumstances where the foster Parent will not have the right
to request a review by an Independent Review Panel is if he or she is
regarded as disqualified as a result of a conviction or caution for a
specified offence -- see Persons Disqualified from fostering procedure.

If no written representations or notification of a request for a review
are received within this period, the decision to refuse the application
can be confirmed.

If written representations are received within the period, the Panel
Advisor will arrange for the reports and other documentation to be
reconsidered by the Fostering Panel, taking into account the written
representations, and make a new recommendation to the Agency Decision
Maker.

The Panel Administrator will advise the applicant within 7 days of the
date of the Panel meeting when they can attend and their written
representations will be considered.

In these circumstances, applicants who wish to attend the meeting of the
Fostering Panel can arrange for a friend or supporter to accompany them.

After considering the representations, the Panel will make further
recommendations either confirming or amending their previous views,
which the Agency Decision Maker will consider before a final decision is
made.

If the decision remains not to approve the application, the manager will
arrange for the applicants to be informed verbally within 2 working
days. Written notice of the final decision, together with reasons, must
be sent to the applicant by the Panel Advisor within 7 working days of
the Panel meeting. Information about the Complaints Procedure must also
be sent. A copy of the report to the Panel, the Panel\'s recommendation
and the decision, with reasons, must be retained on the applicant\'s
case file.

If the applicant decides to refer the matter to an Independent Review,
the relevant Panel reports, any new information obtained since the Panel
meeting, a record of the decision made and reasons, a copy of the
written notification of the decision and a copy of the Panel minute, if
different, will be sent to the Independent Review within 10 working days
of their written request.

The procedure for the Independent Review is carried out by BAAF; the
applicant and two representatives of the fostering agency will be
invited to attend the Independent Review.

After considering the representations, the Independent Review may make a
recommendation, which the Agency Decision Maker will consider before a
final decision is made.

Written notice of the final decision, together with reasons, must be
sent to the applicant within 7 working days of the receipt of the
Independent Review recommendation.

Where the decision is to approve the application, the procedure set out
in the Approval and Assessment Procedure will be followed.
