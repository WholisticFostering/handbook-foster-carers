title: Foster Carer Reviews and Termination of Approval
---


## - Frequency and Timing

Formal reviews of foster carers will take place at least annually and
the first annual review will take place so that it can be reported to
the Fostering Panel within 12 months of the foster carer's approval --
see, Presentation to the Fostering Panel below.

Dates and the venue for review meetings will be agreed by the
Supervising Social Worker in consultation with the foster carer and the
independent chair

Reviews can also take place more frequently - and may be initiated by
the Supervising Social Worker or foster carers - in the event of a
significant change in circumstances of a foster carer affecting the
ability or capacity to foster, for example a change in the composition
of the household, a significant health issue, concerns about the
standards of care provided by the foster carer or persistent use of
inappropriate discipline, serious and/or persistent breaches of the
Foster Care Agreement, a complaint or allegation made about the carer
resulting in a Section 47 Enquiry, concerns as a result of information
from updated Criminal Records Bureau checks or a request/recommendation
for a change of approval.

Where an allegations or concern is raised in relation to a foster carer,
see also Allegations Procedure.

As well as formal reviews, there will be regular supervision, dialogue
and feedback between the Supervising Social Worker and the foster carers
-- see Support and Supervision of Foster Carers.

The first annual review of foster carers must be presented to panel.
Other annual reviews may be presented, at the discretion of the agency.

## - Consultation and Action before Review

Prior to the review meeting, the Supervising Social Worker will collate
all information relevant to the foster carers\' suitability to foster,
including the number and type of placements in the last year,
information from the Looked After Reviews of children placed, any
extensions or exemptions that have been agreed in the previous year,
supervision records, post placement reports and records of any
complaints or allegations made against the foster carers or members of
their household.

The views of the foster carers, all members of the household, any
children placed since the last review, their parents (where appropriate)
and their social workers, and any other professional whose views are
relevant will be sought and taken into account at the review. This will
include contacting social workers for children previously placed but no
longer in the placement. Wherever possible these views should be
reported to the review in writing.

The foster carer and members of the family (including the foster
carers\' own children depending on their age and understanding) will be
asked to complete their own review form for this purpose.

Any updates on checks will also be carried out.

The Supervising Social Worker will prepare a review report stating
whether the carers continue to be suitable to foster and whether the
terms of his or her approval continue to be appropriate. This report
should include a summary of the fostering work undertaken so far and how
this relates to the development of the foster carer\'s skills. Any
recommendations for change in the foster carers\' approval should be
highlighted.

A copy of the review report will then be sent to the foster carers and
once it has been agreed by them, forwarded to the Fostering Service
Manager for approval. A copy will be kept on the foster carer\'s file.

Admin should receive all paper work relating to the review at least 2
weeks before the review meeting.

## - Formal Review Meeting

The Reviewing Officer/ Manager will only be attending second and
subsequent reviews

Review meetings should take place in the foster carer/s home

The review meeting should be attended by the Supervising Social Worker,
foster carer/s and the Reviewing Officer

Minutes of the meeting will be taken by the Reviewing Officer/Manager
who will then compile a report and make a recommendation.

Should the Reviewing Officer/manager have any concerns about
recommending approval then a written report will be presented at the
fostering panel for consideration. Prior to taking this course of action
it should be discussed with the foster carer/s and the supervising
social worker and the fostering manager

In all cases the foster carer/s will view the report by the Reviewing
Officer/Manager and will sign the report as an indication that they are
happy with the account. A copy will be placed on file.

At the end of the meeting a provisional date should be set for the next
review meeting

As well as considering the information collated in advance, the review
will also consider the foster carer\'s safe caring practice, Fire Plan,
training programme and any risk assessment in relation to the family
pets as part of the review. A health and safety checklist will also be
completed.

The review will consider all the available information and views and
reach the following conclusions;

      *  whether the foster carer continues to be suitable to foster children
      *  whether the terms of approval continue to be suitable
      *  what training and development needs the foster carer has
      *  how these needs will be met and who will be responsible
      *  what support needs the carer has, and how these will be met
      *  any difficulties or concerns since the last review
      *  the date for presentation to the Fostering Panel, if relevant

## - Presentation to the Fostering Panel (Terminations)

A report on the first annual review meeting will be presented to the
Fostering Panel within 12 months of the original approval.

Thereafter the review report will be presented to the panel for
approval. This process will be followed unless significant changes to
the foster carer\'s approval or the termination of the foster carer\'s
approval is recommended or where any circumstances exist which in the
opinion of the Reviewing Officer and Fostering Manager require further
consideration. This will include the situation where an updating
Criminal Records Bureau check reveals a new concern about the foster
carer or a member of the household.

In these circumstances, the review report will be presented to the
Fostering Panel.

Where the report recommends termination of the foster carer\'s approval,
the report should give full details of the concerns, allegations or
complaints and the outcome of any Section 47 Enquiry or investigation.
Any mitigating circumstances should be outlined. A copy of the foster
carers\' Form F and any previous relevant Panel minutes should also be
attached to the report.

The report for the Panel will be shared with the foster carer(s) and
they should be invited to submit written comments.

A copy of the report to the Panel (and attachments including any written
comments of the foster carer(s) on the report) should be sent to the
Panel Administrator at least 15 working days before the relevant Panel
meeting.

Foster carers should be invited to attend the Fostering Panel when their
review is being considered, together with a supporter if they wish, and
the Panel Administrator should be informed if they intend to do so.

Where the Review recommends the termination of approval of foster
carers, the review should be presented to the earliest possible
Fostering Panel.

Where the Panel\'s recommendation is for a different category of
approval, the Panel may require further assessment or training for the
foster carer.

Where the review is presented to the Fostering Panel, the Panel\'s
recommendation as to the future approval of the foster carer will be
submitted to the Agency Decision Maker for a decision to be made.

Whether or not the foster carers are present at the Panel, the Panel
Adviser will arrange for them to be informed in writing of the outcome
of the review as soon as possible and at the latest within 5 working
days after a decision is made. The notice will set out:

      * a. that the foster carer and household continue to be suitable and that the terms of the approval continue to be appropriate; or
      * b. that the approval is terminated from a specified date, and the reason for the termination; or
      * c. the revised terms of the approval and the reasons for the revision

## - After the Review

The Supervising Social Worker will write to any social worker for a
child placed with the foster carers to inform them of the outcome of the
review.

The outcome of the review will also be recorded and the Register of
Foster Carers updated as necessary. Where there has been any change in
the terms of the approval, the Foster Care Agreement will be updated and
signed by the Supervising Social Worker and foster carer.

Where the approval is terminated, the Fostering Manager will inform the
Regulatory Authority.

Where the approval is terminated, the Fostering Manager in consultation
with the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), will decide whether
to refer the former foster carer to the Independent Safeguarding
Authority (ISA) under the Vetting and Barring Scheme.

## - Representations Procedure

Where, as a result of a review, the variation or termination of a foster
carer\'s approval is proposed, by the fostering panel he or she must be
advised, when informed of the outcome of the Agency Decision Maker\'s
decision, that if they wish to challenge the decision, they have the
opportunity to make representations to the Panel or to request a review
by an Independent Review Panel, as set out in the Assessment and
Approval of Foster Carers Procedure. The only circumstances where the
foster carer will not have the right to request a review by an
Independent Review Panel is if he or she is regarded as disqualified as
a result of a conviction or caution for a specified offence.

If no written representations or notification of a request for a review
are received within the period, the decision to terminate or vary an
approval can be confirmed.

Where the termination of the approval of a foster carer is being
considered, plans for the termination of any current placement will also
be required and made as appropriate.

## - Updates on Checks Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)

Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) on persons aged 18 and over will be
updated every 3 years and if necessary, a review of the foster carers\'
approval should be carried out immediately to take account of any new
information.

The foster carers should also be asked to complete Declarations of
Health and Suitability every 3 years. In the event of any serious
concerns about the foster carer\'s health, a review of the foster
carer\'s approval will be carried out immediately.

## - Retention of Foster Carer Records

Foster carers\' case records should be retained for a minimum of 10
years after their approval has been terminated.

carer tenders his/her resignation, or when a review considers that a
foster carer or the household is no longer suitable to act as a foster
carer.

1.4 This Policy should be read in conjunction with policy and guidance
regarding the 'Qualifying decisions' and the Representations and
Independent Review Mechanism

2\. Terminating a foster carer approval in response to the foster carer'
resignation

other than Brent Council.

3\. Terminating a foster carer approval following Review

3.1 The Placement Service will review the approval of each foster carer
whenever it is considered necessary and at intervals of no more than one
year. The purpose of the review is to consider whether the foster carer
and their household continue to be suitable to be approved for the
purpose of fostering. In conducting the review, the Placement Service
will make whatever enquiries it considers necessary to inform this
judgement. The review will take into account the views of the foster
carer, any child placed and the responsible authority for any child who
has been in placement during the previous year /

1

last review.

3.2 From time to time concerns may arise about carers. Such concerns may
arise through complaints, allegations and concerns raised by children,
their carers, and / or professionals. Any concerns raised will be fully
investigatedusing the appropriate procedures.

3.3 Where there is a serious concern, for example, which indicates the
carer or someone in the household may have been committed an offence
against a child, caused Significant Harm to a child or has through their
actions demonstrated themselves to be unsuitable to be in a position of
trust of a child, OR where there has been a pattern of several lesser
concerns over a period of time, arrangements should be made to hold an
urgent review of the foster carer's suitability to continue to be
approved having paramount regard for the safety and welfare of children
who are or may be placed.

3.4 The review may determine that the carer and theirhousehold is no
longer suitable for the task of fostering. The Placement Service will
prepare a written report setting out the findings of their review.

3.5 The review report and recommendation, together with the original
Form F assessment and report on carers' progress since approval,
previous panel minutes along with any other relevant papers will be
submitted to the Fostering Panel. The reasons for proposed termination
should be clearly stated.

Panel and be heard. Subject to the need to protect children and deal
sensitively with third parties information the foster carer should be
able to read in advance any reports concerning them which are
beingpresented to the panel and to make any further written submissions
themselves. The foster carer should be furnished with reports as
appropriate,two weeks before the date of Panel meeting. Should the
foster carer wish to make any submission, they should send their
submission to the Placement Service no later than one week before the
Panel date.

3.7 The Fostering Panel will decide whether or not to recommend
termination of approval.

3.8 Where the Fostering Panel does not consider that there is sufficient
evidence to support the termination of approval the Panel will define in
writing matters for further review, e.g. where it is felt the carer
might, with additional support and/or training, achieve the required
standard.

3.9 Once these matters have been further reviewed an updated report and
update will be presented to the Fostering Panel. Again the foster carer
should have the opportunity to attend and be heard.

3.10 The Panel recommendations are passed to the Agency Decision Maker
(ADM) to make the final decision regarding termination.

3.11 When the ADM considers that the foster care and the household is no
longer suitable to be a foster carer, the carer will be notified of that
decision known as the 'determination' in writing setting out the reasons
for this, including a copy of the panel's recommendation.

representations against the decision to the agency decision maker or to
apply to the secretary of state for a review of the determination by the
Independent Review Mechanism (IRM). The provision of the IRM does not
apply to persons being considered under Regulation 26(8).

3.13 If representations are made thy will be considered by the Foster
Panel and the Panel will make a further recommendation to the Agency
Decision Maker.

3.14 If application is made to the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM),
the Agency decision Maker will take into account the IRM recommendation
as well as the original Panel recommendations in making the final
decision regarding termination. (Further information regarding the
Representations and IMR procedures can be obtained from Supervising
Social Worker or any member of the Placement Service.)

3.15 The Agency Decision Maker will finalise the decision taking into
account the recommendations from any IRM or representations made, and
issue within 5 working days a letter confirming the final decision. If
the decision is to terminate approval, the letter will state the reasons
for the termination and the date from which the termination will take
effect.

3.16 If no representations are made the Agency Decision Maker will
finalise the decision at the end of the 28 day period and issue a letter
confirming the termination stating the reasons for the termination and
the date from which the termination will take effect.
