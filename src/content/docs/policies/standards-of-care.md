## 📜 Introduction & Legal Framework

Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 -- Regulation 15 National
Minimum Standards -- Standard 6 Children Act 1989 Guidance -- Volume 4:
Fostering Services

Wholistic Fostering is committed to maintaining the highest standards of
care for every child we look after.

Children have a right to:

-   Be safe and feel valued
-   Have their physical and emotional needs met
-   Be supported by skilled, knowledgeable carers

Ensuring quality care is a shared responsibility between:

-   Foster carers
-   Supervising Social Workers
-   Family Placement Managers

## 🛠 Monitoring Standards of Care

Supervising Social Workers (SSWs) monitor foster care practice
regularly. Minor concerns are addressed through:

-   Support and guidance
-   Training
-   Supervision sessions

More serious concerns are addressed through this **Standards of Care**
process.

## 🚩 When Concerns Arise

If a concern about a foster carer's standard of care is raised by:

-   A child or young person
-   A social worker
-   Another professional or foster carer

\...the concern must be:

-   Documented by the SSW using a **Foster Care Notification**
-   Reported to the **Family Placement Manager** within **1 working
    day**

The Family Placement Manager will assess whether the concern should be
treated as:

-   A **Standards of Care** issue
-   A **safeguarding concern** (i.e. potential significant harm)
-   A **complaint**

## 📋 Standards of Care Process

If the concern **does not meet the safeguarding threshold**, the SSW
will:

-   Arrange a visit to the foster carer within **5 working days**
-   Discuss the issue in reference to relevant **National Minimum
    Standards**
-   Agree an **action plan** and timescales for improvement
-   Record the discussion and share a signed copy with the carer

If the carer **disagrees** with the actions, a **Standards of Care
Meeting** will be arranged.

## 🔴 If It\'s a Serious Concern

If the concern relates to possible **significant harm**, the following
must happen:

-   The **Allegations Against Foster Carers Policy** and local
    safeguarding procedures are followed
-   The carer may be suspended while the matter is investigated

## 🧑‍⚖️ Standards of Care Meeting

A meeting will be arranged if:

-   A serious single concern arises
-   There are **3 concerns** in 12 months
-   A **whistleblowing** report requires wider discussion
-   A safeguarding meeting concludes there\'s no harm, but concerns
    remain

Minutes will be recorded and added to the foster carer's file.

## 🔁 Foster Carer Review

If required, a **Foster Carer Review** will be held to:

-   Assess if approval remains appropriate
-   Recommend changes to terms of approval
