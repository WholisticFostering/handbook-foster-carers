Introduction and Underpinning Regulations and Standards

\<WRAP center round info 70%\> The Fostering Services (England)
Regulations 2011 regulation 15 states that the fostering service
provider 'must promote the health and development of children placed
with foster parents'.This is also addressed in National Minimum Standard
6 Promoting good health and wellbeing. Under regulation 15, the
fostering service must ensure that each child: • Is a registered patient
with a general medical practitioner • Has access to such medical,
dental, nursing, psychological and psychiatric advice, treatment and
other services as he/she may require • Is provided with such individual
support, aids and equipment which he/she may require as a result of any
particular health needs or disability he/she may have, and • Is provided
with guidance, support and advice on health, personal care and health
promotion issues appropriate to his/her needs and wishes. The Children
Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations Volume 4: Fostering Services goes into
more detail on these matters and the requirement to ensure that foster
carers and staff possess the appropriate skills and knowledge to meet
children's health needs, administer basic first aid, minor illness
treatment and medication.The guidance also requires carers to be clear
about delegated authority in matters of health and treatment (paragraphs
3.49-3.62). \</WRAP\>

## Introduction

Wholistic Fostering is committed to providing the highest standards of
care for looked after children we look after. Children and young people
have the right to feel safe, to be treated with respect, and to be a
valued, and receive a quality of care consistent at least with the
National Minimum Standards 2011. Ensuring the maintenance of good
quality care will be central to the Supervising Social Workers role in
working to support the Foster Carer. The Family Placement Manager will
ensure that processes for ensuring a safe quality environment are
maintained and address minor issues through regular supervision of
Supervising Workers and monitoring the service.

## Investigating Concerns for Standards of Care

Poor standards of care will be investigated under the management of the
Family Placement Manager or Assistant Manager.

Complaints received from or about a young person's care should be
recorded using the Complaints form and logged and resolved using the
complaints procedure. This may include minor complaints that should be
quickly and informally resolved.

If a Supervising Social Worker or the child/young person's Social Worker
receives information from another party or notes themselves a serious
concern regarding a foster carer's performance in meeting standards of
care, this should be recorded on a Foster Care Notification and sent to
the Family Placement Manager within one working day.

The Family Placement Manager will decide whether the matter should be
investigated as a Standards of Care matter or as a safeguarding issue or
complaint. They must ensure that the Serious Occurrence is recorded and
logged, with details of the concern and an eventual outcome. (To be
passed to administration team for logging and saving.)

It is important that any subsequent discussion about the cause of
concern is couched in respect of standards/competences which are not
being met so that there can be an objective measure of the concern.

Where the Fostering Manager confirms that the concern should be dealt
with under the Standards of Care Procedure, the Supervising Social
Worker must arrange to visit the foster carer within 5 working days of
receiving the information to discuss the cause for concern.

In discussion with the Foster Carer the Supervising Social Worker will
make the Foster Carer aware of the relevant National Minimum Standard
2011 and the relevant training standard.

The Supervising Social Worker will recommend how the issues will be
addressed, and propose timescales for completion of the action to bring
standard of practice to the required level.

The Supervising Social Worker will record the visit and include in the
record any actions and recommendations. This record will be signed by
both parties.

The Supervising Social Worker will send a copy of the record of this
visit to the Foster Carers within 5 working days.

If the Foster Carer does not agree to the proposed remedial action at
the end of the meeting, a Standards of Care meeting will be convened
which has access to this record.

## Serious Causes for Concern­ Child Protection

Where there are concerns that the standards of care may reach the
threshold of 'significant harm' in relation to the emotional, sexual and
physical health of the child the Allegations Against Foster Carers
Procedures and Local Safeguarding Children Procedures should be applied.

## Standards of Care Meeting

These meetings are in place to ensure any serious and / or repeated
concerns expressed by Looked After Children, Social Workers and others
in relation to the care offered by Foster Carers are fully explored and
a record is maintained.

This meeting will be arranged where one of the following occurs:

-   The Family Placement Manager decides that any single concern is of
    sufficient concern to warrant a meeting;
-   Three concerns about a Foster Carers care or practice in any 1 year
    period (where appropriate and in discussion with others the
    Fostering Service Manager may decide concerns raised do not merit a
    Standard of Care meeting). Where this occurs a record including the
    reasons for this decision will be recorded on the foster carer's
    file; \-- *Note: all issues regarding standards of care are
    currently addressed with the Foster Carer by their Supervising ­
    Social Worker (or another member of the Family Placement Service as
    directed by the Family Placement Manager, without delay.*
-   Another Foster Carer uses the Family Placement Service
    Whistleblowing Procedure and the Family Placement Manager decides a
    meeting with greater attendance is required to fully address the
    concerns raised;
-   A LSCB Strategy Meeting has determined that the threshold of
    significant harm is not met, however concerns about the care offered
    or Foster Carers willingness to work with the Agency still remain.

### Process

The Foster Manager or Senior Supervising Social Worker will write to the
Foster Carer to inform them of the chronology of complaints, the
date/venue and invitation list for the meeting.

The Supervising Social will deliver the letter/chronology within 5
working days. The Supervising Social Worker will explain the content of
the letter to the Foster Carer.

The invitation list to include Foster Carer, Family Placement Manager or
Assistant Manager, current Child's Social Worker(s) and Manager and if
appropriate previous Social Worker, Fostering Manager, District Team
Manager.

The Family Placement Manager or Assistant Manager will chair the meeting
and minutes will be taken by a member of staff.

### Purpose

-   To enable a full and open discussion on the identified concerns and
    identify a way forward. The potential outcomes to consider may be:
    additional training and/or closer supervision of the Foster Carers
    practice to support development. The Foster Care Review could be
    brought forward. Whether or not this happens the next annual Foster
    Care Review Chairperson shall have access to the Minutes of the
    Standards of Care Meeting.

The Supervising Social Worker will ensure the detail of the recorded
cause for concern/s within the Standard of Care meeting are detailed
within their report (FCR3) for the next Foster Care Review.

### Meeting

-   Reason for Meeting;
-   Any previous concerns in relation to the Foster Carer;
-   Sharing Information;
-   Work already undertaken to resolve the issue;
-   Agreed actions, date and by whom;
-   Decision about whether the Foster Care Review to be brought forward
    and the Agency's recommendation as to the Foster Carers continued
    approval.

A copy of the minutes will be kept in the Carers Record.

## Foster Care Review

Where it is decided a Foster Care Review is required, the review must
consider if the carers approval remains suitable to foster or whether
their terms of approval should be changed.

If the foster carer does not wish to engage in a foster carer review,
the matter can be taken directly to the Fostering Panel. If the matter
is referred to the Fostering Panel, Foster Carers will have access to
independent support.

If a proposal to terminate approval has been made by the Agency Decision
Maker, the foster carers may make representations within 28 days to the
Agency Decision Maker.

Any Notification Form should be recorded on the Foster Carers file and
the Chronology, with an outcome clearly stated.
