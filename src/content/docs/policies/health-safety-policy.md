## 1. Introduction

As part of your preparation to foster, you will have been provided with
information on health and safety and be clear on what your
responsibilities are as a carer. Each fostering household will have had
a Health and Safety assessment as part of the initial approval, and will
include additional assessments if you have a pet, gun, swimming pool or
holiday home. This will be reviewed at least annually by your
supervising social worker. You may also receive a visit from an
Inspector from Ofsted as part of the inspection process for the
fostering service.

Foster homes should provide a warm and welcoming environment where
children are safe from harm or abuse as well as bullying. The home
should be clean and well maintained including decor.

## 2. Equipment

Your supervising social worker will talk to you about any safety
equipment WHOLISTIC FOSTERING may be able to offer. This could involve
equipment for young children such as safety gates and car seats.

Generally WHOLISTIC FOSTERING expects you to decorate and furnish the
room/s available for fostering before your first placement. There should
be enough space to provide a bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers and space
to study. You will be expected to provide most equipment including a
computer for your personal use as well as for the foster child.

Where you are asked to provide a placement outside your usual age
category in an emergency, WHOLISTIC FOSTERING may be able to help with
the cost of equipment, particularly if it is to enable you to care for a
baby.

## 3. Health and Safety - Facts

In terms of context, nearly half of all childhood accidental injuries
occur at home or in the garden. Figures from the Child Accident
Prevention Trust indicated that '121 children died from accidents in the
home, of these 86 children were under 5 years old. Over a million
children and young people under 15 visited hospital with accidental
injuries that had happened at home.

Falls account for almost a quarter of all home accidental injuries to
children. They are the most common single cause of home accidental
injury.

Collisions with a person or object are the second most common type of
accidental home injury and the only one where the injury rates are
approximately the same for children of all ages. Typically these
injuries happen when children run into objects, run into each other or
are struck by a falling object.

Burns and scalds are the third most common injury. They particularly
affect babies and very young children with scalds from hot drinks being
the most common cause.

The fourth most common reason for children being taken to hospital is
suspected poisonings. These happen when parents or carers think that
children have consumed medicines, household cleaners, DIY or gardening
chemicals. Nine in ten suspected poisonings involve children under the
age of 5. Carers need to be aware of the associations that children make
between medicines and sweets as well as the tendency of children to copy
or learn from adult behaviour, so carers need to consider this when
taking medication themselves.

Most accidents happen in the lounge / living room / dining room -
probably reflecting where children spend most of their time. The next
most common places in the home for accidents to take place are the
kitchen, bedroom and stairs.

Young children are not able to assess risk themselves. They also have
poor co-ordination and balance and need to touch and explore as part of
learning about the world around them. As children get older they learn
new skills and begin to understand what they are able to do safely but
will still need to test out their new abilities which will involve
raking some risks.

Children and young people grow and learn new skills rapidly. It is
important that carers who care for children know what risks each
developmental stage brings and plan for this. It is impossible to fully
'childproof' a home but knowledge of the potential for accidents and of
effective safety measures can reduce the incidence and severity of
these.

There are a number of reasons why looked after children will be at a
higher risk of accidents in the foster home;

      * Your own children will be aware of the potential hazards in their house as they will have grown up with them. Most foster children are joining the house will wish to investigate their surroundings and the absence of good safety measures could increase the risk of injury.
      * Looked after children may also have developmental or learning difficulties or behavioural difficulties and if these are not taken into account and assumptions are made about their abilities, they are likely to be more at risk from similar hazards than their peers.
      * Some looked after children may not have received appropriate guidance within their birth families and may have deficits in knowledge e.g. how to cross the road safely.
      * A smaller but not insignificant number may have a tendency to self harm and particular attention will be needed to minimise the potential risk to such children.

All carers are expected to purchase smoke detectors and a First Aid box
(at their own expense) as part of being able to demonstrate safe care in
their home. A child will not be placed until these are obtained.

Where new placements are made; the Health and Safety checklist must be
re-visited to ensure it meets the needs of the individual child.

## 4. General Guidance

      * Health and safety standards should be met in the foster home, garden, and any other land or buildings to which foster children will have access.
      * You must provide a suitable home environment in which the foster child can live and learn about potential dangers and you must discuss with the child’s social worker how to manage these issues with the child.
      * Accommodation should be clean, hygienic, and in good decorative order and repair.
      * It should have adequate heating, lighting, bathing and toilet facilities.
      * A child’s bedroom should be sufficiently large enough to comfortably contain a single bed, chest of drawers and wardrobe and have access to natural light.
      * All children need their own personal space, which includes storage and drawers/cupboards in which to keep their belongings, as well as the opportunity to display pictures of their family and other items of personal significance.
      * There must be opportunities and space for age appropriate play.
      * Stair gates must be used when necessary. Open sided stairs are not suitable when young children are being cared for and may have to be covered.
      * Windows must be safe, with locks or safety catches fitted to prevent children from falling out.
      * A smoke detector must be fitted, ideally in each foster child’s bedroom and on the staircase landing. This should be regularly checked and conform to British Standards.
      * When curtains and furnishings are replaced they should be non-flammable and conform to appropriate UK standards.
      * Blinds should be checked to ensure there are not dangerous hanging fittings.
      * Household cleaners, bleaches, washing powders, matches, alcohol, pills and medicines or any other potentially dangerous substances or other items (such as sharp knives) should be kept out of reach and must be locked away, as appropriate according to the age and understanding of the children in the household.
      * Low level electric sockets will require safety covers when young children are being looked after. Sockets should not be overloaded. There should be an awareness of the need to make safe trailing flexes from electrical equipment and make sure they do not constitute a danger. Extension leads must not be plugged into other extension leads.
      * Wires, ornaments and pictures should not be left in places where they are obvious hazards.
      * Toys purchased should be carefully considered in relation to health and safety. Foster children who ride bikes must use cycling helmets. Foster children who go horse riding should do so with a registered instructor and wear a safety helmet. If riding outside a body protector should also be used. You should ensure that the riding school has appropriate insurance in place. Appropriate protective clothing should be provided to children when they are roller-skating, ice skating or skate boarding or involved in similar activities.
      * Garden areas should be checked for potentially dangerous equipment and sharp objects. The area must be secure so that young children cannot get out should they temporarily be out of sight. Ponds should be covered or adequately fenced if young children are playing outside. Any animal faeces should be removed immediately. Gardens should be checked for dangerous plants. This should also include internal houseplants. The local authority parks department can advise. Foster carers with swimming pools must ensure that children cannot get access to the water when unsupervised. The separate WHOLISTIC FOSTERING risk assessment must be completed to cover this.
      * Care should be taken to ensure that food is stored hygienically and according to the product label.
      * Saucepans and cookers can present many dangers and carers should be extremely mindful i.e. turning handles inwards, using a cooker guard.
      * For young children, radiators will need to be guarded and where heating is by fire/gas/electricity/coal etc, fireguards are essential.
      * Sharp edges such as tables should have corner protectors.
      * Stair and floor coverings should be well fitted. Rugs need to be secure.
      * Dustbins should be covered properly with fitting lids and regularly disinfected, both inside and out and kept separate from children’s play areas.
      * Children must be protected from the harmful effects of smoking, including passive smoking.
      * You must ensure that your home and contents insurers are informed that you are caring for foster children in your home and that the insurers have given written confirmation of this fact. You should keep a copy of the letter you send to your insurers so that even if you do not receive a reply you have proof that you have notified the company.
      * Each child will have their own bedroom, unless they are part of a same sex sibling group, (or are siblings under 5 years) and it is considered to be in their best interests to share a room. A child under 18 months may share your bedroom. This decision as to whether children can share a bedroom with your or siblings is made following an assessment of their needs and a risk assessment. The supervising social worker will ensure that the outcome of the assessment is recorded in writing on the child’s file. This should also be incorporated into the placement plan drawn up with the local authority. Any assessed change in the needs of the child should be discussed with the child’s social worker.
      * It is your responsibility to provide age appropriate guidance to the child in placement on health and safety issues e.g. crossing the road.

## 5. Lifting and Handling

You should ensure that you understand the right way to lift a child and
heavy or awkward objects. Moving things the wrong way can cause you to
have physical damage - such as back injuries, sprains, cuts and bruises.
This advice may be of use.

**Reduce the risk:**

      * Training is important, to help you learn to move and lift properly.

**Prevent pain injury and damage:**

      * Examine what you are going to lift, check to see if the load is stable and equally distributed. Decide whether the object is likely to be too heavy to lift safely. Look for any sharp edges.
      * Check whether there is an alternative to lifting, check whether it can be divided into smaller loads.
      * Decide before hand how to hold the object. Protect your hands and feet by gripping the load firmly.
      * Avoid becoming overtired. Frequent lifting, lowering, and moving is demanding work and can cause stress to the muscles and joints. Take short rests regularly, and do other tasks between moving items if you can.
      * Lift with your legs.
      * Stand in a comfortable position. Lift smoothly, keeping the load close to your body. Don’t twist your body. Avoid lifts above your shoulders and below your knees - these put extra strain on your back.
      * Keep hands clear. Be careful not to crush your fingers when you are putting things down

**Learn to lift things the right way to reduce the risk of injuring your
back, arms and legs:**

      - Think before you do anything. Examine the box or load first. Make sure it’s not damaged and won’t split or break when you carry it.
      - Stand as close the load as possible. Spread your feet to create a stable base.(slide the load closer to you if it’s on a shelf)
      - Bend your knees and keep your back in a natural line. Don’t bend your knees fully, as you won’t have the power to lift.
      - Grip your load firmly.
      - Raise your head as you start to lift.
      - Lift with your legs. Don’t twist with your body. Use your leverage, momentum, balance and timing for a smooth action.
      - Hold the load close to the centre of your body as you carry it.

**Carrying:**

      * Keep the load close to your body.
      * Keep your arms tucked in to prevent your neck or shoulder muscles from getting tired or injured.
      * Don’t change your grip on the load unless it is weight supported.
      * Don’t twist your body, stoop, bend or lean back. If you must change direction, move your feet instead.
      * Don’t block your vision by carrying something that is too big. Use a mechanical aid or get help if you need it.
      * Face the spot where the load will rest on by turning your feet and whole body in that direction.

**Unloading:**

Be as careful setting down the load as you were when lifting it.

      * Bend your knees to lower the load. Keep your back straight and the load close to your body
      * Be careful with your fingers and toes. Make sure there is enough room for them when you put the load down.
      * Put the load on a bench or table by resting it on the edge and pushing it forward with your arms and body
      * Slide the load if it needs to go into a tight space - it is much easier and safer than trying to lift it.

Make sure the load is secure wherever you place it. Make sure it won't
fall, tip over, roll or block someone's way.

## 6. First Aid

You will be provided with training in First Aid, which needs to be
refreshed every three years. You must maintain an adequately stocked
First Aid Kit. This should include items such as waterproof plasters,
fabric plaster strip, antiseptic wipes / cream, eye-wash, crepe bandage,
tweezers and scissors. (However, please remember that some children have
an allergy to plasters - so if possible get this information from the
birth parents.)

## 7. Swimming Safety

You need to follow certain standards when children in placement are
involved in water based activities. This should include the use of arm
bands for all non swimming children.

Where possible, water based activities should take place where a
qualified lifeguard or a qualified instructor is in attendance. It is
best wherever possible, to swim within prescribed areas laid down by
official beach authorities.

Where this is not possible, you should ensure that the child/ren are
kept under close supervision by an adult swimmer at all times. This can
mean standing at the waters' edge or being in the water, but the
critical thing is to take no risk at all with currents and tides. If you
have any doubt about sea conditions, do not allow children to go in.

It might be useful for you to have a floating object at hand that can be
used as a buoy in the event of a child getting into difficulty in the
water. However, rubber rings and lilos should only be used as play
objects if they have a line attached and that line is held by the
supervising adult.

Inflatable boats and toys should only be used in the water when
supervised by an adult who is a strong swimmer. On these occasions, a
strong line should be attached to the dinghy and secured to a base on
the beach.

Other water based activities (canoeing, sailing, wind surfing, surfing
etc.) should only be allowed under qualified supervision and life
jackets must be used.

You must ensure that you have appropriate insurance to cover dangerous
sports. You must seek permission from the local authority if you plan to
undertake these.

## 8. Car Safety

Surveys have shown that a substantial proportion of parents do not use
child restraints when transporting their children, and many of the child
seats that are used are incorrectly fitted. 'All children under 12 years
and under 4\'11\" (1.48m) travelling in cars must use a restraint, if a
suitable one is available anywhere in the vehicle \' (RoSPA 2001). This
is to supplement the fitted seat belt and ensure that the child is both
comfortable and safe when travelling.

We would always advise you to use the appropriate restraint for the
child. Child restraints are divided into categories according to the
weight of the children for which they are suitable. It is the weight of
the child that is most important when deciding what sort of child
restraint to use. Child restraints must conform to a British or a
European standard. Please take advice on the type of restraint for the
child you are caring for. However, we offer the following guidelines:-

      * Never place a rearward facing baby seat on the front passenger seat in cars where a passenger air bag is fitted. This could cause serious injury.
      * Carrycots are no longer considered to offer sufficient protection in vehicles. Infants should be provided with a suitable car seat.
      * It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that all passengers are wearing seatbelts.

Any vehicle used for transporting a foster child must have up-to-date
road tax, MOT, insurance and car safety seats and safety belts in good
working order. You need to notify your insurance company of your role
and the fact that you will be transporting children.

You must ensure that any child being driven in their car is wearing a
seatbelt at all times.

There are a number of websites providing advice and guidance on child
safety in cars - these may be helpful:

## 9. Fire Safety

This guidance aims to significantly reduce the chance of a fire
occurring in the home, and should a fire occur, it provides advice about
how to ensure that everyone gets out of the home safely.

**Prevention:**

      * When cooking, take care if you’re wearing loose clothing as it can easily catch fire. Keep electrical leads, tea towels and cloths away from the cooker and hob.
      * Never leave children alone in the kitchen. Keep matches, lighters and saucepan handles where children can’t reach them, and fit a fire safety catch on the door.
      * Keep the oven, toaster and grill clean - a build up of fat, crumbs or grease can easily catch fire.
      * Don’t use matches or lighters to light gas cookers - spark devices, which you can buy from hardware stores, are safer.
      * Don’t leave pans on the hob when you are not around. Take them off the heat if you have to leave the kitchen.
      * Angle saucepan handles so they don’t stick out from the hob, or over a naked flame.
      * Don’t put anything that is metal or metallic inside the microwave.
      * When you have finished cooking, make sure you switch off the oven and hob.

**Looking after the electrics:**

      * Keep electric leads and appliances away from water.
      * Turn off electrical appliances when they’re not being used and service them regularly.
      * Don’t overload electrical sockets. Only have one plug in each socket.

**Deep frying food:**

      * If you regularly deep-fry, consider buying an electric deep-fat fryer. They have thermostats fitted so they can’t over heat and are safer to use.
      * If you do not have a deep fat fryer and use an ordinary pan, never fill it more than one-third full.

**What to do if your pan catches fire:**

Don't take any risks - get everyone out of the home and call the Fire
Brigade.

      * Don’t move the pan and never pour water on it.
      * Turn off the heat under the pan (if it is safe to do so) and allow it to cool completely.

Plugs and cables:

      * Unplug electric appliances when you’re not using them.
      * Don’t overload sockets - use one plug in each socket
      * Don’t put cables under carpets or mats.
      * Make sure that the plug has the correct fuse for the appliances
      * Check for signs for loose wiring and faulty plugs or sockets (such as scorch marks or flickering lights), and have any problems you find fixed.
      * Replace worn or taped up cables and leads.

**Cigarettes, cigars and pipes:**

      * Take extra if you are tired, taking prescription drugs or have been drinking alcohol.
      * Don’t leave cigarettes, cigars or pipes unattended.
      * Keep matches and lighters out of reach of children.
      * Where possible buy child-resistant lighters and matches.
      * Tip your ash into an ashtray - never a waste basket - and don’t let the ash or cigarettes ends build up in the ashtray.

**Using candles:**

      * Keep candles where children and pets can’t reach them, away from draughts, and away from anything that can easily catch fire (for example, furniture, curtains or newspaper).
      * Make sure a candle is standing up straight and is fixed firmly in a proper holder so that it can’t fall over.
      * Always place candles on heat resistance surface.
      * Don’t lean across a candle as you could set your hair on fire.
      * Always leave at least 10cm between two burning candles and never place them under shelves or other surfaces.
      * Always put candles out, if you are going to move them.

**Smoke alarms:**

      * At least one smoke alarm should be fitted to the ceiling on each floor level in your home.
      * The best place for a smoke alarm is where you can easily hear them, ideally in hallways and landings.
      * Smoke alarms should be properly maintained - test your alarms weekly and replace the battery every year, unless a 10 year battery is fitted.

**Fire extinguishers:**

      * These are pressurised cylinders containing powder, foam or carbon dioxide which shoots out in a jet. Fire extinguishers are quick and simple to use - you point them at the fire and shoot the jet at it. There are different types of extinguishers for different types of fires. Always read the instructions and make sure you have the right extinguisher for the type of fire.
      * The best place for an extinguisher is in the hall, so you can take it wherever it is needed.

**Night time safety check:**

      * Switch off and unplug electrical appliances.
      * Check that the oven, grill and hob are switched off.
      * Don’t leave the washing machine, tumble dryer or dishwasher running overnight.
      * Turn off all gas and electric heaters, and put a guard in front of an open fire.
      * Check that candles are out. Never leave one burning when you go to sleep.
      * Make sure that any cigarettes, cigars and pipes have been put out properly, and never smoke in bed. You could fall asleep and accidentally set fire to your bedding.
      * Close doors. By shutting doors you can keep your escape route free from fire. This is particularly important in homes where you would not be able to escape from a window, for example if you live in a high rise flat.
      * Turn off your electric blanket (unless it has a thermostat and is designed to be left on overnight.)
      * Check your escape route is free from obstacles and make sure door and window keys are in the right place.

**Children:**

Young children can be curious about the fire and flames, so it's also
important to teach them how dangerous fire can be and how quickly it can
get out of hand. Don't avoid talking to the children because you don not
want to frighten them. If a fire starts without an adult around,
children need to know exactly what to do.

      * Get them involved with making your escape plan, and practise it regularly to keep it fresh in their minds.
      * Make sure babysitters know your escape plan, including what to do if there is a fire.

**Teaching children to be safe with fire:**

      * Encourage children in your care to tell you if they find matches or lighter.
      * Encourage older children to be more responsible by letting them take part in safe, fire-related activities, eg lightening a candle, under supervision of an adult; and
      * Explain to older teenagers the risks of causing a fire from smoking. Even if they do not smoke, they’ll probably go to parties where others do. Candles are also popular with teenagers, so explain how to use them safely.
      * Teach the children in your care what to do if there is a fire.

**Fire safety rules for children:**

      * You can never play safely with fire - it can get out of control really fast.
      * Never play with matches or lighters. If you see matches or lighters lying around, tell a grown up.
      * Never play with a lit candle
      * Don’t play close to a fire or a heater, or leave your toys near a fire or heater.
      * Don’t pull on electric cables or fiddle with electric appliances or sockets.
      * Never switch the oven or hob on.
      * Don’t touch any saucepans on the hob.
      * Don’t put anything on top of heaters, lamps or other lights.
      * If you see a fire, tell a grown up immediately and don’t try to put it off.

### 10 Tips to protect your home:

      - Fit smoke alarms on each level in your home. Keep them free from dust and test them once a week.
      - Make a fire action plan so that everyone in your home knows how to escape.
      - Keep the exits from your home clear so that people can escape if there’s a fire. Make sure that everyone in your home can easily find the keys for the doors and windows.
      - Take extra care in the kitchen - never leave young children alone in the kitchen.
      - Take extra care when cooking with hot oil. Consider buying a deep fat fryer, which is controlled by a thermostat.
      - Never leave lit candles in rooms that nobody is in or where children are on their own. Make sure candles are in secure holders on a surface that doesn’t burn and are away from any materials that could burn.
      - Get into the habit in closing the doors at night. If you want to keep a child’s bedroom door open, close the lounge and kitchen door. This may help save their life if there is a fire.
      - Don’t over load electrical sockets. Remember one plug to one socket.
      - Take special care when you are tired or have had a drink.
      - Don’t leave the TV or other electrical appliances on standby as this could cause a fire. Always switch them off and unplug when not in use.

### Fire Escape:

**Planning your escape**

Once a fire starts, it takes hold quickly and spreads even faster. A
fire is frightening and it can be difficult to think straight,
especially if your hall is filled with smoke and you're worried about
getting you and your family out.

On average, people can survive for less than five minutes in a
smoke-filled room. Preparing and practising a plan of action will help
you to act quickly if there's a fire - it could even save your life.

**Plan your escape together**

      * Discuss with everyone how would you get out if there were a fire. When making your plan, take account of everyone in the household, especially children and older or disabled people.
      * Talk through you escape plan, and regularly remind people what to do - and what not to do, if there’s a fire.
      * Put a reminder somewhere about what to do somewhere where it’s easily seen (for example, on the fridge door or the kitchen notice board).
      * Choose an escape route, and if there are children, older or disabled people in the household plan how you will get them out and the best order of escape.
      * If you cannot escape you will need to find a room where you can wait for the Fire and Rescue Service.
      * If possible your safe room should have a window which opens and a phone.
      * Decide where the keys to the doors and windows should be kept and always keep them there. Everyone in the household should know where the keys are kept.
      * Fire extinguishers should only be used on a small fire in its early stages and by adults who are absolutely sure they know how and when to use them. The first priority in keeping people safe is getting them out of the building and calling the Fire Service.

### What to do if there is a fire:

\*\**Stop -Think - Act.* \*\*

\*\*Fire Plan 1 - \*\* If the smoke alarms go off when you're asleep,
shout to wake everyone up, get everyone together, follow your escape
plan and get out of the building.

      * Don’t stop to investigate the fire or to collect valuables.
      * Use your escape route to get everyone out and meet at an agreed point.
      * Close any doors that are open, and only open the doors that you need to go through.
      * Check doors with the back of your hands, if the door is warm, don’t open it - fire is on the other side.
      * Once you have got everyone out of the building, use a mobile phone, a neighbours phone or phone box and dial 999. Give the emergency operator your name and address.
      * Don’t go back into the building for anything. If there is still someone inside tell the fire service when they arrive - they will be able to find the person quicker and more safely than you.
      * Find somewhere safe to wait near the building and give the fire service as much information as possible about the fire and the building.
      * If fire is blocking your way out, use Fire plan 2.

\*\*Fire Plan 2 - \*\* Smoke can be deadly. If you have to go through
it, crawl under it.

      * If you can’t use the stairs to get out, get into a room where it would be safest to drop from the window (i.e. onto a flat roof).
      * Always pass children down first.
      * Never jump. Lower yourself to arms length and drop. Once out phone 999. If you can’t escape through a window use fire plan 3.

**Fire Plan 3**- If you are trapped in a room by smoke or fire, you need
to stop smoke getting into the room.

      * Close the door.
      * Block any gaps around the door using spare clothing, towels or blankets.
      * If there is a phone, dial 999.
      * If there is no phone, go to the window and shout “FIRE”.
      * If your windows are double glazed and your only escape is through them, use a heavy object and aim it at the bottom of the window. Make any jagged edges safe with a towel or blanket.

**Further Advice:**

Your local fire brigade may be able to undertake a home visit and offer
free advice on smoke alarms and the best fire escape route for you and
your family.

## 10. Outdoor Areas

If you have a swimming pool or a pond it should be covered, fenced off
or drained.

Any chemicals should be kept in a locked, safe place which children
cannot get them.

Any out buildings such as garages and sheds should be locked.

If you have slides and swings, they should be secure with a soft
surrounding area.

A greenhouse/shed should be in good repair and any glass should be away
from the play area or made of toughened glass.

Barbecues should be closely supervised and children should never be left
unattended near them. Barbecues can remain hot for a long period of time
after use and they should be damped down once finished with. Children
should not be allowed to light barbecues. Never leave barbecues
unattended.

If children play unsupervised in the garden, then gates and fences
should be secure.

Some fairly common garden plants are poisonous and some are fatal.
Children may eat berries and think they are ok. Poisonous plants should
not be in the garden. If they already are, you should remove them.

## 11. Pets

You should not keep a dog defined under the Dangerous Dogs Act; this
would mean your re-approval would not take place.

Where children have allergies to pets (for example in relation to asthma
or eczema) you should talk to your supervising social worker about how
best to minimize the effects.

If you do have pets, you should keep their areas including the garden
clean and regularly changed.

## 12. Gas Appliances

You should make sure that any appliances are in good working order and
regularly serviced by a Gas Safe engineer.

## 13. Transport

There is a separate section regarding this, see
[Transport](/wiki/policies_transport?&#transport).

## 14. Concerns about Health and Safety

If there are concerns about any aspects of your home, then your
supervising social worker will discuss this with you and a period of
time will be given to resolve the issue. If the issue remains a
significant concern and is not resolved, then a report will go to the
fostering panel to consider your approval.

Your supervising social worker will support and guide you to create and
maintain a safe and caring environment. They will also help you with
developing your Safer Caring Policy and arranging a break (respite) from
fostering where this is agreed as part of the child's care plan.

This information will be reviewed and amended along with any changes in
legislation to make sure you provide the safest possible family home.
