Wholistic foster homes should always be warm, welcoming and safe. This
policy outlines our expectations and guidance to ensure every foster
child is protected from avoidable risks and supported in a healthy,
caring environment.

## 📚 Relevant Standards

-   [NMS Standard 10 - Providing a suitable physical
    environment](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192705/NMS_Fostering_Services.pdf)
-   [TSD Standards 2 & 3 -- Understanding your role & health and
    safety](http://www.fosteringhandbook.com/tact/files/foster care tsd standards guidance.pdf)

## 🛡️ Our Approach

All Wholistic carers:

-   Complete a health & safety checklist during assessment
-   Receive annual reviews of home safety
-   Are supported to keep their home safe for children of all ages and
    needs

Supervising social workers offer advice and may provide equipment (e.g.
safety gates, car seats). Smoke alarms and a basic first aid kit are
mandatory before a child is placed.

## 🧸 Home Safety Essentials

Foster homes must:

-   Be clean, in good repair, and safe throughout
-   Offer safe, age-appropriate space for each child
-   Keep medicines, cleaning products, sharp or hot items safely stored
-   Ensure smoke alarms work and are tested regularly
-   Have secure windows, stair gates (where needed), and socket covers
    for young children
-   Store food hygienically and follow UK food safety standards

## 🚸 Supervision & Awareness

Looked-after children may face increased risks due to:

-   Developmental or behavioural needs
-   Unfamiliarity with house rules or safety hazards
-   Self-harm risks or impulsive behaviours

Foster carers should:

-   Supervise young children closely
-   Provide clear health and safety guidance appropriate to the child\'s
    age and understanding
-   Use safety equipment appropriately indoors and outdoors

## 🚗 Transport & Car Safety

-   All vehicles used must be safe, insured, taxed and MOT-compliant
-   Car seats must match the child\'s weight and height, and meet legal
    standards
-   Seat belts must always be worn
-   Carers must inform their insurer about fostering

## 🔥 Fire Safety

All homes must have:

-   Working smoke alarms on every floor
-   Night-time fire safety checks (e.g. switch off appliances, close
    doors)
-   A clear fire escape plan known by all household members

Other key points:

-   Keep matches, lighters, candles and electrical items away from
    children
-   Unplug unused items; don't overload sockets
-   Use fireguards and avoid trailing cables
-   Train children in safe fire behaviour (e.g. what to do if there's a
    fire)

## 💪 Lifting & Manual Handling

Carers should avoid injury by:

-   Using correct posture and lifting techniques
-   Asking for help with heavy objects
-   Taking regular breaks when doing physical tasks

## 🩹 First Aid & Training

-   All carers must complete First Aid training (updated every 3 years)
-   First Aid kits must be stocked and accessible
-   Know how to respond to minor injuries and when to seek medical help

## 🏊 Swimming & Water Safety

-   Non-swimmers must use armbands
-   Prefer supervised swimming areas with lifeguards
-   Sea or open water swimming should only occur with extreme caution
-   Inflatable toys must be tethered or supervised
-   Always seek permission for high-risk activities (e.g. canoeing,
    sailing)

## 🌳 Garden & Outdoor Safety

-   Ponds and pools must be fenced or covered
-   Gates and fences must be secure
-   Dangerous plants or garden items must be removed
-   Pets must be safe, well cared for, and not from banned breeds
-   Outdoor areas should be free of hazards and pet waste

## 🔧 Gas & Home Appliances

-   All gas appliances must be serviced regularly by a Gas Safe engineer
-   Electric equipment must be in good condition and used safely

## 🏘️ Shared Rooms

Children need their own room unless:

-   They are under 18 months (may share with carer)
-   They are same-sex siblings under 5 and sharing is in their best
    interest

This must be supported by risk assessment and included in the Placement
Plan.

## 🚨 When There Are Concerns

If your supervising social worker identifies concerns about home safety:

-   You will be supported to resolve them within an agreed timeframe
-   Unresolved concerns may be referred to panel for review of approval

## 🔁 Policy Review

This policy is reviewed regularly in line with legislation and guidance
to ensure the highest standards of care and safety for every child.
