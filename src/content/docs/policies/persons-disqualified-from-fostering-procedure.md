title: ​​Persons Disqualified from Fostering Procedure
---


SCOPE OF THIS CHAPTER

This procedure applies to all new applications for approval as foster
parents and to all foster parents who have already been approved as
foster parents.

## 

## 1. Persons Disqualified from Fostering

A person is disqualified from acting as a foster carer for the agency
(unless a relative of the child or already acting as a foster parent) if
s/he or any adult member of the household has been cautioned for or
convicted of a specified offence committed at the age of 18 or over.

A specified offence is defined as offence against a child\*, an offence
specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4 of the Fostering Services Regulations
2011, the importation/possession of indecent photographs of a child
under 16 and any other offence which involves bodily injury to a child
(other than common assault or battery).

\*A list of these offences is set out in the Criminal Justice and Court
Services Act 2000, except that it does not include an offence contrary
to section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (sexual activity with a
child) where the offender was under 20 when the offence was committed
and the child was aged 13 or over.

In addition, a person is disqualified from acting as a foster parent for
the agency (unless a relative of the child or already acting as a foster
carer) if s/he or any adult member of the household has been cautioned
for or convicted of an offence specified in paragraph 1 of part 2 of
Schedule 4 of the Fostering Services Regulations 2011 committed at the
age of 18 or over OR falls within paragraph 2 or 3 of Part 2 of Schedule
4, notwithstanding that the offenses listed have been repealed.

Non discourse of any cautions or convictions will result in the
termination of the assessment.

## 2. New Applications

Where [Disclosure and Barring Service
(DBS)](http://trixresources.proceduresonline.com/nat_key/keywords/dis_barring_service.html)checks
reveal that an applicant for approval as a foster parent is a
disqualified person, the applicants must be advised that their
application cannot proceed. This must be confirmed in writing to them,
together with the reasons, and retained with their application form. The
file should also be closed electronically.

Where the applicant is a relative or friend of the child seeking
approval as a foster parent for a specific child and the person would
otherwise be regarded as disqualified, an application for consent to
proceed with the assessment in relation to the particular child can be
considered by the Agency Decision Maker on the recommendation of the
Fostering Panel.

In these circumstances, the assessing social worker responsible for
carrying out the checks on the prospective foster parent should prepare
a report on the application setting out:

      - The reasons for the application
      - The circumstances surrounding the conviction or caution which would result in the person being disqualified unless consent is given
      - An assessment of whether the placement would meet the child’s needs despite the conviction/caution and
      - A recommendation as to whether the application should proceed.

The assessing social worker will arrange with the Panel Administrator a
date for the Panel to consider the report and the report should be sent
to the Panel Administrator 10 working days before the relevant Panel
meeting.

The Panel minutes will be sent to the Agency Decision Maker (Fostering),
who will consider the recommendation of the Fostering Panel on any such
applications.

The decision of the Agency Decision Maker (Fostering) will be recorded
in writing and a copy placed on the case record of the applicant. A copy
of the decision will also be sent to the person concerned. The decision
will also be entered on the electronic records.

## 3. Approved Foster Parents

Where information is provided or updating [Disclosure and Barring
Service](http://trixresources.proceduresonline.com/nat_key/keywords/dis_barring_service.html)(DBS)
checks reveal that an approved foster parent has been convicted of or
cautioned for a criminal offence as a result of which he or she will
become a disqualified person unless consent is given, an urgent review
of the foster parent\'s approval should be held -- see Review of Foster
Parents Procedure and a written report detailing the circumstances
leading to the conviction/caution, together with background information
from the foster parent's case record, must be presented to the Fostering
Panel as soon as possible. The report should contain a recommendation on
whether consent should be granted to allow the foster carer to continue
to be approved as a foster parent for the child or children currently in
placement.

The report should be sent to the Panel Administrator at least 10 working
days before the relevant Panel meeting.

Where such information is received, the social worker for any child
currently in the placement must be informed and plans for the
termination of the placement will also need to be considered as
appropriate.

Where the report recommends the termination of approval of the foster
parent, the report should be presented to the earliest possible
Fostering Panel.

The Agency Decision Maker will consider the recommendation of the
Fostering Panel on any such applications.

The decision of the Agency Decision Maker will be recorded in writing
and a copy placed on the case record of the foster parent.

Written notice of the decision, together with reasons, must then be sent
to the foster parent as soon as practicable.

Where a decision is made to terminate the approval of the foster parent,
the Representations Procedure as set out in Assessment and Approval of
foster parent(s) Procedure, Reprenstation/Independent Review will apply.
