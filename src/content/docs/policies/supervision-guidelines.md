title: Supervision guidelines
---


It is good practice to programme **monthly supervision meetings** for
the year. Frequency of supervision will reflect:

      * The supervisee's level of experience and competence (not necessarily length of service);
      * If the supervisee is in their probationary period (i.e. the first six months of service) supervision should take place every two weeks. These may be short sessions and will enable the supervisor to assess the supervisee's suitability for permanent employment and ensure an effective relationship is formed in the early days of employment;
      * Any particular circumstances that apply to the supervisee which may require more frequent supervision (e.g. a difficult piece of work, the level of risk associated with work, personal difficulties or relationships, or levels of stress);
      * Frequency should be agreed between the supervisor and supervisee when negotiating the terms of the individual Supervision Agreement;
      * Any deviation from the recommended monthly supervision, as a permanent feature, should be recorded in the supervision agreement between the two parties and the supervisor must inform their line manager of this decision, in or before their next supervision;
      * Part-time, agency and temporary staff working with children, young people and foster carers should all receive supervision on a monthly basis. 

**There will be occasions when dates have to be changed but this should
be avoided whenever possible and alternative dates set**. It is the
supervisor\'s responsibility for rescheduling the meeting. It is
important that supervision meetings begin and end promptly.
