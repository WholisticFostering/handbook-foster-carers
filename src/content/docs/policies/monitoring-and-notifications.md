title: Monitoring and Notifications
---


All notifications should be submitted through the eform:

<https://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/notification/>

This is a very similar form to the form used by Ofsted and will create
an internal ticket on the help desk that will form the basis of
documenting progress until a notification has been concluded,

## - Scope

This chapter lists the agencies that must be notified by the fostering
agency where certain events occur within the agency's foster homes or in
relation to children placed in one of the agency's foster homes.

It reproduces the table in Schedule 7 of the Fostering Services
Regulations 2011 and is compliant with Standard 29 of the NMS standards
for Fostering Services

Wherever an event listed in the table occurs within one of the agency's
foster homes or in relation to a child or children placed in one of the
agency's foster homes, the person receiving the information must
immediately inform the Designated Manager, who is responsible for
sending the notifications to the agencies listed.

Notifications will be sent as soon as practicable after the even has
occurred.
