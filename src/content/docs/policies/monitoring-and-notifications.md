All notifications must be submitted using our internal e-form: 👉
**[Submit a Notification
Form](https://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/notification/)**

This form mirrors the Ofsted format and creates an internal helpdesk
ticket to track and manage the issue until fully resolved.

## 📘 Scope

This policy outlines the events that must be reported by Wholistic
Fostering to external agencies, in line with:

-   **The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011** -- Schedule 7
-   **National Minimum Standards** -- Standard 29

When any listed event occurs in a foster home or affects a child in
placement, the **Designated Manager** must be informed immediately. They
are responsible for notifying relevant agencies **as soon as
practicable** after the event.
