title: 📋 Family and Friends Foster Carers Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-28
---


Wholistic Fostering currently has no approved family and friends foster
carers and no plans to approve any at this time. This policy will be
updated if that changes.

## Underpinning Standards

National Minimum Standard 30 states that:

\*The needs and circumstances of family and friends foster carers should
be taken into account when determining the fostering service's policies
and practices.\*

## Future Practice

If Wholistic begins to assess or approve family and friends carers, this
policy will be expanded to include:

-   Assessment and approval processes
-   Training, supervision and support
-   Placement matching and safeguarding
-   Ongoing review in line with foster carer review procedures

## Review

This policy will be reviewed regularly and updated if plans change.
