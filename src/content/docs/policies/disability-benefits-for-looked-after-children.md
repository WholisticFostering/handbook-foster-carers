title: Disability Benefits For Looked After Children
---


The following information sets out guidance for social workers and
foster carers regarding the management of benefits for looked after
children who have a disability.

Where a child is eligible for benefits as a result of a disability,
foster carers are encouraged to apply for those benefits.

There are regular recorded discussions in supervision about how any
additional benefits are to be spent in order to promote the best
interests of the child.
