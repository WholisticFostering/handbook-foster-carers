All approved foster carers with Wholistic must have a current Foster
Carer Agreement in place.

-   Agreements are reviewed and updated each year.
-   We manage agreements digitally through Docracy.

## 📜 Legal Framework

As required under Regulation 27 of the Fostering Services (England)
Regulations 2011, foster carers must enter into a written agreement that
covers:

-   The terms of their approval
-   Support and training arrangements
-   The review process
-   Placement procedures and the Placement Plan
-   Legal liability cover
-   How to make complaints or raise concerns
-   The carer\'s duties and responsibilities

These agreements set out mutual expectations to ensure clarity, support,
and safe, consistent care for children.
