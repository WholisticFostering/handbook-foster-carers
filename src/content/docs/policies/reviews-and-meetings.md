title: 📋 Reviews & Meetings Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-06-22

This policy explains how Wholistic Fostering supports the review of a
child's Placement Plan, contributes to LAC Reviews, and takes
part in Disruption Meetings when placements end unexpectedly.

## 📋 Placement Plan Reviews

Every child must have a **Placement Plan**, usually created at the start
of the placement with the child's social worker, foster carer, and
Supervising Social Worker (SSW). In emergencies, this should happen
within 5 working days -- see [Placements with Foster
Parents](/policies/placements_with_foster_parents).

Placement Plans are reviewed at each **Looked After Review**. If changes
are needed between reviews, the social worker may hold a separate
**placement review meeting** with the carer and SSW, involving the child
and family where appropriate. Any updates must be shared with all
involved.

## 🔄 Disruption Meetings

When a placement ends earlier than planned, a **Disruption Meeting** may
be arranged---either by the placing local authority or Wholistic
Fostering, depending on the case.

Key points:

-   Usually held within **14 days** of the placement ending.
-   Chaired by the Fostering Manager (unless agreed otherwise).
-   Attended by the child's social worker, foster carers, SSW, and
    others involved.
-   The child and parents should be invited unless inappropriate.

The purpose is to learn from the placement and improve future planning.
It's not about assigning blame, but understanding the **full picture**,
including:

-   The child's history and needs
-   How the placement was matched and supported
-   Introductions, transitions, and support offered
-   Positive experiences and challenges
-   The child's wishes and feelings

This helps shape future planning and prevents repeat disruptions.

## 👩‍⚖️ Looked After Reviews & Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO)

**Looked After Reviews (LARs)** are led by the Placing Authority. Foster
carers and SSWs contribute to these reviews by:

-   Providing written updates
-   Attending the meetings where required
-   Sharing their observations about the child's care, progress and
    needs

IROs chair these reviews and ensure the Care Plan is on track,
effective, and child-focused.

**LAR timelines:**

-   1st review -- within **20 working days** of placement
-   2nd review -- within **3 months** of the 1st
-   Ongoing -- at least every **6 months**
-   Also triggered by:
    -   Unplanned placement move
    -   Significant changes in care needs
    -   Concerns about the child\'s safety
    -   Proposed end to accommodation

If reviews don't happen as expected, the SSW should raise this with the
child's social worker and escalate to the IRO if unresolved.

## 🧾 Preparing for Reviews

At least **20 days before** the review:

-   The child's social worker should confirm who will attend and where
    the meeting will take place
-   The SSW will help prepare the carer's report and share it with the
    social worker to distribute **10 days before** the review

The report should cover:

-   Child's health, education and emotional wellbeing
-   Placement stability and routines
-   Any concerns or achievements

Children should be supported to complete a **review form or letter**,
and be offered the help of an **advocate** or **Independent Visitor**,
if appropriate.

## 🧑‍⚖️ The Role of the IRO

IROs have an independent role in overseeing the child's care planning
and ensuring their views are central.

They:

-   Chair all Looked After Reviews
-   Ensure the child's voice is heard and understood
-   Monitor progress and intervene when needed
-   Highlight poor practice and delays
-   Ensure decisions follow current law and best practice

If the IRO believes the Local Authority is failing the child, they can:

-   Raise it with senior management
-   Refer the case to **CAFCASS** if needed

## 🗂️ Review Records

After a review:

-   The IRO should send out decisions within **5 working days**
-   The full record must be shared within **15 working days**
-   Everyone involved must receive it within **20 working days**
-   The child's Care Plan should be updated within **10 working days**
    of the review
