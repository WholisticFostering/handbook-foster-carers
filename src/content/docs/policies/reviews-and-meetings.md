title: Reviews and Meetings
---


## Scope

This chapter explains how the fostering agency contributes to the
reviewing of the Child's Placement Plan and Care Plan as well as the
arrangements for Disruption Meetings.

## Placement Plan Reviews

Each child placed with foster carers must have a Placement
Agreement/Placement Plan, detailing the arrangements and care for the
placement of the child. This should be drawn up by the child's social
worker in conjunction with the foster carer and the foster carer's
Supervising Social Worker, at the pre-placement planning meeting. Where
the placement is made in an emergency, the Placement Agreement/Placement
Plan should be drawn up within 5 working days of the placement -- see
Placements with Foster Care Procedure.

The Placement Agreement/Placement Plan will be reviewed at the child\'s
Looked After Review.

Where it is necessary to review the placement arrangements between
Looked After Reviews, then this can be done by the child's social worker
in conjunction with the foster carer and the foster carer's Supervising
Social Worker as well as with the child, parents and others affected.
This will usually take place at a placement plan review meeting convened
by the child's social worker.

If the outcome of any review is that the Placement Agreement/Placement
Plan is amended, then the amendment should be circulated by the child's
social worker to all those participating in the review process.

## Disruption Meetings

When a placement ends prematurely, a disruption meeting will be convened
to review the child\'s case history. This may take place under the
procedures of the Placing

Authority. However, where this is not the case and it is considered that
a disruption

meeting should take place under this procedure, a discussion should take
place with the Placing Authority about whether they are prepared to
engage with the agency convening the meeting under this procedure.

In this case, the Fostering Service Manager will usually chair the
meeting and the child and parents should be invited unless it is
considered inappropriate to do so. The child's social worker, the foster
carers and the foster carers' Supervising Social Worker should also be
present.

Ideally the meeting should take place within 14 days of the end of the
placement and the notes of the meeting should be kept on the child\'s
record.

The purpose of a disruption meeting is to examine various elements of
the placement in order to understand the sequence of events leading to
the disruption and learn lessons from what occurred.

This will:

      * Help the child by understanding his or her needs better
      * Improve practice by understanding what went wrong
      * Recognise all the positive work and good experiences for the child amongst all the difficulties
      * Support every-one and help them carry on and recover
      * Demonstrate that disruption is never the fault of one or two people or the result of a single factor; it is invariably the outcome of a whole series of connected factors 

Please note: The Disruption Meeting is not a planning meeting, but is an
opportunity to review the past as a preparation for the child's future.
Future planning should occur within the child's Looked After Review*.*

In order to understand the placement, it is necessary to consider the
child's history and experiences of parenting the child has received,
previous placement moves and any relationships in the child's life. The
child's wishes and feelings will be central in this process. A crucial
stage to look at is the matching process -- i.e. the assessment of the
child's needs at the time of seeking the placement to see how accurately
these were understood at the time and the assessment of what the foster
carers could offer and the support they were given in understanding and
providing for the child's needs. The meeting will also look at the
child's introduction to the placement and any other issues relating to
the placement.

## Looked After Reviews and the Role of the Independent Reviewing Officer

Looked After Reviews, sometimes called \'Statutory Reviews\', are
convened and conducted by the Placing Authority. The fostering agency
will play their part in these reviews through the foster carers and/or
the Supervising Social Workers by providing information and, if
appropriate to do so under the Placing Authority's procedures, attending
the meetings.

They are formal meetings, chaired by an Independent Reviewing Officer
(IRO).

The purpose of the Looked After Review is to:

      * Ensure that appropriate plans are in place to safeguard and promote the overall welfare of the Looked After child in the most effective way and achieve permanence for him or her within a timescale that meets his or her needs 
      * To monitor the progress of the plans and ensure they are being progressed effectively 
      * To make decisions, as necessary, for amendments to those plans to reflect any change in knowledge and/or circumstances. 

The review should also take account of the child\'s Placement
Agreement/Placement Plan and any other plans or strategies (e.g.
behaviour management strategy), ensuring that they are up to date or
that arrangements are in place to update them.

Looked After Reviews should normally be convened at the following
intervals:

      * The Initial Looked After Review should be conducted within 20 working days of the child becoming Looked After; 
      * The second Looked After Review should be conducted within three months of the Initial Looked After Review; 
      * Subsequent Looked After Review should be conducted not more than six months after any previous review. 

Looked After Review should also be convened:

      * As soon as practicable where a child is moved from one placement to another on an unplanned basis or a significant change in the circumstances of a child suggests his/her placement is no longer appropriate. 
      * At the request of the Independent Reviewing Officer
      * If a significant change to the child’s Care Plan is proposed
      * Where, as a result of a social work visit, the assessment is that the child’s welfare is not being adequately safeguarded and promoted.
      * Where the Placing Authority is proposing to cease to provide accommodation for the child.

If Looked After Reviews are not arranged or conducted as set out above,
the Supervising Social Worker will initially raise concerns with the
child's social worker. If matters are not resolved, s/he will contact
the child's Independent Reviewing Officer.

### Preparation for the Review

Discussion should take place at least 20 days before the review between
the child's social worker and the child regarding where the meeting
should be held and who should attend. It is the child' social worker's
responsibility to ensure that invitations and papers are sent to those
involved in the review at least 10 days before the meeting takes place.

When arrangements are made to conduct a Looked After Review, the
Supervising Social Worker should collaborate with the child\'s carer(s)
and arrange for a full report to be devised and forwarded to the
child\'s social worker in time for them to circulate documentation 10
days prior to the review date. The report should detail events
surrounding the child\'s care, education, health etc. since the last
Review. The report will be forwarded to those attending prior to the
date of the meeting.

Children should be encouraged to complete a review questionnaire or
prepare their own report/letter for the review.

If it appears to be necessary or the child requests it, an advocate or,
if appointed, an Independent Visitor should be asked to accompany the
child to the Review.

The IRO may adjourn a review meeting once, for not more than 20 working
days, if not satisfied that sufficient information has been provided by
the Local Authority to enable proper consideration of any of the factors
to be considered. The IRO should consider the effects on the child of
delaying the meeting, and seek the wishes and feelings of the child,
carer and parents where appropriate. No proposal under consideration at
the review can be implemented until the review has been completed.

### Record of Reviews

//Following the review: //

      * The IRO should produce a written record of the decisions or recommendations made within five working days of the completion of the review and a full record of the review within 15 working days of the completion of the review. 
      * The full written record of the review, including the decisions, should be distributed within 20 working days of the completion of the review. 
      * Within 10 working days, following the completion of the review, the social worker should update the Care Plan in relation to any changes agreed at the review. 

### The Role of the Independent Review Officer

Independent Reviewing Officers (IRO) should be allocated to a child for
the duration of the time that they are Looked After. Siblings should
share the same IRO.

Before the first review the IRO should meet the child.

As well as the role of chairing Looked After Reviews, the IRO has a duty
to have effective and independent oversight of a child's case which they
should monitor. The child's social worker should provide the IRO with
information about the child's progress and any significant events.

As part of the monitoring function, the IRO also has a duty to identify
any areas of poor practice, including general concerns around service
delivery (not just around individual children).

The responsibilities of the IRO now include:

      * A responsibility to consult the child about his/her Care Plan at each review and at any time that there is a significant change to the Care Plan;
      * Ensuring that care plans for looked after children are based on a detailed and informed assessment, up to date, effective and provide a real response to each child’s needs;
      * Identifying any gaps in the assessment process or delivery of service;
      * Offering a safeguard to prevent any ‘drift’ in care planning and the delivery of services;
      * Monitoring the activity of the Local Authority:  that Care Plans have given proper consideration and weight to the child’s current views, wishes and feelings and that he/she fully understands the implications of any changes to their Care Plan, and
      * Ensuring that, having regard to age and understanding,  the child  has been informed of the steps he/she may take under the Children Act 1989, and in particular, where appropriate, of
        * The right to apply, with leave, for a Section 8 Order/discharge of a Care Order - if the child wishes to take legal proceedings under the Children Act 1989, the IRO must establish whether an appropriate adult is able and willing to assist the child to obtain legal advice or bring proceedings on his/her behalf, and, if there is no such person, assist the child to obtain such advice.
        * The right to access representations/complaints procedures 
      * Making sure that the child understands how an advocate could help and his or her entitlement to one.

Up to 1 April 2011, IROs had the authority to refer the case of any
looked after child to CAFCASS if they were of the view that the child's
human rights had been breached and all attempts to resolve the matter
had been exhausted. The scope for such referrals is now extended.

The IRO now has the authority to refer a case to CAFCASS if he/she
'considers it appropriate to do so'

The IRO must consider whether it is appropriate to refer a case to
CAFCASS if:

      * In his/her opinion, the Local Authority  has failed in any significant respect to  prepare the child’s Care Plan; review the child’s case or effectively implement any decision in consequence of a review; or are otherwise in breach of their duties to the child  in any material respect, and
      * Having drawn this to the attention of persons of appropriate seniority in the Local Authority, the issues have not been addressed to IRO’s satisfaction within a reasonable period of time.
