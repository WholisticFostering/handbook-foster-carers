# Absence Policy

## Policy Statement

- This Policy is designed to establish a framework for the effective management of sickness absence. It sets out Wholistic Fostering’s commitment to the fair, equal, and consistent treatment of all members of staff in managing sickness absence.
- The Policy relates to all members of staff and should be read in conjunction with the **Guidance Notes for Staff**. Line Managers should also read the **Guidance Notes for Managers**.
- The Policy determines the procedures for recording and reporting sickness absence and provides Managers with a framework that promotes good employment practice while enhancing the delivery of the service through improved cost efficiency by considering both the welfare of all members of staff and the requirements of individual Faculties and Service areas.
- Professional advice and support is available at all stages of the absence management process from the designated HR Adviser.
- WF recognises that long-term sickness absence is harmful, that work can be good for health, and can also reverse the harmful effects of long-term sickness absence.

## Aims of the Policy

- To provide a safe and healthy working environment for all members of staff while sustaining continuity and stability and avoiding undue disruption to the services to students and other clients.
- To provide a supportive environment for members of staff affected by ill health by ensuring that all sickness absence is managed responsibly, fairly, and consistently.
- To treat members of staff who are ill sympathetically and provide support to assist recovery while safeguarding employment.
- To achieve and maintain optimum staff attendance levels as the loss of working days through unnecessary sickness absence can be a significant cost to WF through work not completed, or the cost of arranging cover for absence, as well as the additional pressure placed on colleagues.
- To balance WF’s operational needs and the interests of the individual member of staff in the cases of long-term sickness and disability.
- To improve rates of attendance and increase motivation and morale by encouraging and developing a positive culture towards attendance at work.
- To clearly set out WF’s responsibilities and expectations in relation to attendance at work.

## Scope of the Policy

- This policy applies to all members of staff across all grades and groups: permanent, fixed-term, temporary, full-time, part-time, or sessional.

## Responsibilities

- Directors should ensure the Policy and guidelines are implemented and adhered to.
- All Managers are responsible for adhering to the Absence Policy and will be expected to apply the principles in their day-to-day work and activities.
- Managers are responsible for consistently applying the Policy to all members of staff who fall under their remit. Should the matter of a member of staff’s sickness absence proceed to a formal stage, an alternative HR Adviser will provide support and advice to the Manager, or the member of staff can request an alternative HR Adviser to provide support and advice at an earlier stage.
- Members of the Human Resources (HR) Department are responsible for providing advice and guidance on the proper, fair, and consistent application of this policy.
- Sickness Administrators have a responsibility for the accurate and timely recording of sickness absence and for the safe retention and storage of Statements of Fitness for Work (Fit Notes).
- Any member of staff shall have the right to be accompanied by a friend or Trade Union Representative to both informal and formal meetings regarding sickness absence.
- All members of staff have a responsibility for supporting the aims of this policy, complying with the sickness notification procedure (see Guidance for Staff).

## Sickness Recording

- Each Faculty/School and Service Area has a designated Sickness Administrator responsible for recording sickness. All Fit Notes must be forwarded to the Sickness Administrator for recording.
- The recording of absence allows Managers to identify patterns and high levels of absence, whether short or long term. It also allows for the identification of work-related absences or other causes.

## Overview of Reporting and Monitoring Procedure

- Every period of absence must be reported to the Line Manager detailing the reason for the absence. (See Guidance for Staff for further detailed information).
- When appropriate, HR may contact the member of staff during his/her sickness absence to determine further information regarding the absence.
- A return-to-work interview should be held with the Manager and member of staff following every period of absence.
- WF will monitor absence with a view to identifying problem areas. Disciplinary proceedings will be invoked should any member of staff be found to be deliberately abusing the procedure.

## Guidance Notes for All Members of Staff

### Role of the Member of Staff

Each member of staff is expected to:

- Comply with WF’s sickness notification procedure.
- Ensure they are aware of the name of their Sickness Administrator and their contact details.
- Seek medical advice and treatment, where appropriate, as quickly as possible.
- Keep in regular touch and inform the Line Manager, or nominated person, of any significant developments affecting the absence.

### Sickness Notification Procedure

- Members of staff must notify their Line Manager or Sickness Administrator of their absence within one hour of their normal start time. They should call personally unless exceptional circumstances prevent them from doing so.
- Provide the following information:
  - General nature of the absence.
  - Likely duration of the absence.
  - A contact telephone number.
  - Information about current workload to help reschedule tasks.
- Communication by text for sickness notification is not acceptable and will result in the absence being recorded as unauthorised.
- Absences beyond 7 days must be covered by a Fit Note, which must be submitted to the Line Manager or Sickness Administrator.
- Failure to follow the correct notification procedure or provide Fit Notes may result in disciplinary action.

### Early Return to Work

- Members of staff must notify their Line Manager at least one day before returning to work earlier than the expiry of their Fit Note.
- For long-term absences, up-to-date medical advice may be required before returning to work.

### Sickness During/Before Annual Leave

- If a member of staff falls ill during annual leave, they can reclaim the holiday if they provide a Fit Note.
- If a member of staff is unfit for work before previously booked leave, the sickness absence is considered over once the holiday begins unless a Fit Note states otherwise.

## Managing Persistent Intermittent Sickness Absence

- Persistent intermittent sickness absence is defined as frequent short-term absences from work, often sporadic and attributable to minor ailments.
- Managers should monitor absence records and identify patterns or trends, such as frequent absences on specific days or around holidays.
- Managers should address persistent absences through return-to-work interviews, informal discussions, and, if necessary, formal disciplinary procedures.

## Managing Long-Term Sickness Absence

- Long-term absence is defined as a continuous absence lasting several weeks or months due to a serious health problem.
- Managers should maintain regular contact with the member of staff, seek medical advice if necessary, and explore options for a phased return to work or reasonable adjustments.
- If a return to work is not possible, alternative employment or ill-health retirement may be considered.
