title: Training and Development of Foster Carers
---


## - Introduction

This policy sets out the commitment, practice and review to learning and
development within Wholistic Fostering. It has been developed in
conjunction with the National Minimum Standards for Foster Care and the
Training, Support & Development Standards Framework. It sets out
expectations in relation to the agency, the work force and Foster Carers
in relation to all aspects of learning and development.

## - Statement of Intention

Whilst fostering is often highly rewarding it can also be complex and
challenging. The challenges of care are both diverse and extensive,
often requiring a significant developmental journey for child and Foster
Carer/s. The foundations of high quality professional foster care are
built upon dedicated, committed and passionate people who receive
rigorous and robust support and training.

We believe that Foster Carers must be enabled to access learning and
development opportunities throughout their fostering career. The
landscape of childcare is changing all the time and new thinking,
research and practice developments is constantly becoming available. Our
service is committed to reflect this in the training programme and
ensure it becomes fluid and dynamic to capture these opportunities.

This will ensure they have the skills and knowledge they need, and allow
them to develop their practice in order that they can help transform the
lives of the children they foster.

Wholistic Fostering is dedicated to delivering a comprehensive suite of
training that equips Foster Carers with the skills, knowledge and
confidence important in supporting and engaging often very bewildered
and vulnerable children and young people. As an organisation we
recognise the developmental nature of Fostering and variety of learning
styles.

### - Core Aims

Our core aims are to:-

-    Offer continuous professional development through training events
    that are credible, relevant and that connect directly with the
    fostering task
-    To include our Foster Carers in the development of our training, in
    forming a partnership that commissions events that reflect their
    needs, areas of interest and affords opportunities for sector
    recognised qualifications.
-    To keep our Foster Carers updated in relation to legislative and
    policy changes, new guidance and best practice developments,
-    To differentiate the training to reflect diversity, levels of
    ability, learning styles and experience.
-    To make training accessible and available in different forms
    including face to face, e learning, additional reading
-    To provide our Foster Carers with an individual continuous
    professional development plan that aligns to their developing
    fostering career.
-    To offer opportunities for individual, shared and group learning in
    environments that are educative, empowering and value past
    experience.

### - Achieving our core aims

To achieve this we will:-

-   Provide you and your family with appropriate and relevant training
    by trainers who understand the fostering task. At appropriate times,
    including weekends and evenings.
-    Provide you with other development opportunities which make the
    best use of your skills and expertise, such as mentoring, support,
    further reading and qualification.
-    Provide opportunities where Foster Carers can share their views of
    training and development and contribute to the strategy of the
    agency on a regular basis. These will include: - evaluation forms,
    group forums, supervision, Foster Carer reviews or direct contact
    with the training department.

## - Learning, Development and Support

Foster Carers must be enabled to access learning and development
opportunities throughout their fostering career. This will ensure that
Foster Carers have the skills and knowledge that are needed and allow
for their development and growth in practice. This is recognised as an
essential ingredient of parenting, supporting and assisting the children
and young people placed at Wholistic Fostering.

In England, The National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services state
that all Carers maintain a Training Portfolio (NMS 20.4).

~~There is a section at the back of the Foster Carer Handbook for carers
to keep their Learning and Development Records which can be held
electronically or in hard copy. This should include all notices of
training that are sent to carers and the record of their reply. Course
notes; hand-outs; attendance certificate and the completed Record of
Continuing Professional Development, should be kept here. There is also
a list of courses that are available to carers and as carers they are
able to add in the dates that they have attended.~~

There is an expectation that Foster Carers will:

-    Be prepared to develop their skills throughout their fostering
    career
-    Attend relevant training
-    Take up training opportunities offered
-    Let Wholistic Fostering know if they are unable to attend training
    events and contribute to support groups. This is best achieved
    through contact with the Administrator or Registered Manager and can
    be by phone or email. The earlier the notice can be provided the
    better as it helps with planning and delivery.

## - Pre-Approval Training

All applicants (including where there is a second applicant) undertake
the Wholistic Fostering two day Preparation Training programme called
Tools to foster. This has been developed and is based on the nationally
recognised Skills to Foster programme and been made specific to the
fostering service of Wholistic Fostering.

The programme delivers the first two days prior to the commencement of
the skills based fostering assessment (BAAF Form F).

The identification of areas for skills and knowledge development informs
the creation of the personal development pathway and priority training
needs post approval.

   Tools to Foster to include:-

## - Post Approval Training

~~Subject to approval by the Agency Decision Maker an individual
training record is created for the Foster Carer and, where there is a
joint Foster Carer household, for both applicants.~~

Induction is undertaken by the Supervising Social Worker and takes place
within 3 weeks of approval. The TSD standards workbook is introduced and
initial planning for completion is started. This is incorporated into a
personal development plan that includes identification and completion of
core training.

All newly approved Foster Carers for Wholistic Fostering are required as
part of their approval to complete all the Probationary Grade training
within the first two years of approval:-

            ~~Core and Complementary Training (to be completed in two years)~~

\*\* Mandatory Courses have to be completed by Secondary Carers \*\*

This training is mapped to the TSD standards and NMS (see appendix 1).
It forms a central part of the portfolio and it is the agency policy
that this training is completed as part of The TSD Standards. At the end
of the first twelve months it is a requirement that the TSD Standards is
completed.

\<del\>Where both partners in a household are approved foster carers the
expectation of Wholistic Fostering is that the secondary carer completes
all mandatory training as above. We respect completely the pressures of
work and other priorities for partners We will always look at making
elements of the core training as accessible as possible through
different mediums; examples might include through, supervision, E
learning courses, weekend training; external reading and abbreviated
materials. Whilst we expect the carer to achieve the core training
within the first twelve months, there is scope and acceptance this may
take longer for a second carer. This is fine providing the term for
completion is not open ended and there is a realistic plan for
achievement in place.

We have made this commitment in accordance with guidance and best
practice and in recognising the important support role second carers
take in the lives and welfare of the children placed. Our commitment is
to invest in core elements of learning for both parts of the carer
partnership.\</del\>

A common question asked is can I only undertake core training? Our
policy response is no this is a minimum expectation and we welcome
additional attendance at training events. We would ask that the PDP
prioritises core training but if there is the space and capacity to do
more we are happy for this expectation to be exceeded.

### - Post Approval Training (what next after 12 months?)

There will be training available for all Foster Carers throughout the
year. Following the first annual review you will be expected to continue
with your professional development through supervision every month and
by attending training.

After the first two years the main carer is expected to undertake 15
courses within the 3 levels of the training pathway. These are in
addition to any refresher requirements that will fall as part of a
training year. In building a credible learning and development portfolio
the minimum expectation is that the primary carer achieves 4 courses
each year of approval. As stated this is the minimum requirement and the
agency encourages and welcomes carers who exceed this standard.

The agreed and chosen programme for Foster Carers will be delivered
between January to December. \<del\>Training will not normally take
place during the school holidays. \</del\>

In acknowledging the working and personal commitments of Foster Carers
especially where this is a Second Foster Carer the training calendar
will look to include weekend and evening training opportunities. These
will be detailed as such in the training calendar. Our commitment as an
agency is to continue to connect the second carer to continuous
professional development through a variety of flexible ways that reflect
the competing demands on their time. Learning might be through E
learning courses, directed reading, supervision, and attendance at group
forums. It is expected that the second carer remains up to date with
refresher requirements detailed in the core training.

## - Training, Support and Development Standards (TSD)

The Training, Support and Development (TSD) standards form part of a
Foster Carer's induction in the role. They provide a national minimum
benchmark that sets out what Foster Carers should know, understand and
be able to do within the first 12 months after being approved. All
Independent Fostering Providers and Local Authorities supporting foster
carers throughout the UK have a duty to ensure that the 'Training,
Support and Development Standards for Foster Care' (TSDS) are
implemented and to ensure that carers have access to pre-approval
training, induction and on-going professional development. Ofsted who
are responsible for inspecting social care services will be charged with
regulating this.

A Foster Carer about to start the TSD standards can expect to receive
help and advice in planning their evidence and completing the workbook
by their supervising social worker. ~~Additional support is available
through workshops (detailed in the training calendar as part of the
group forums)~~.

Wholistic Fostering has developed in conjunction with the TSD standards
an internal workbook that takes you through each section of the
standards, and is available in PDF and editable Word formats. The
workbook is a tool to help Foster Carers plan, gather and record
evidence of their learning and development. It will enable Foster
Carer/s to meet the evidence requirements. All Foster Carers will have a
portfolio in which to keep their evidence and are encouraged to add to
their portfolio each time they attend training or gain new knowledge.

Full guidance covering the completion of the standards is provided
alongside the workbook and is available in hard or electronic copy.

Where there is a joint application then you have a choice. You could
undertake a joint portfolio that includes the full evidence of the
primary carer and that which relates to the role taken by the second
carer. Alternatively if you wish you can do individual portfolios.
Wholistic Fostering is happy to assist you in deciding the best option
and how this can be achieved.

~~Where there are two full time carers and fostering is the primary role
for both, in accordance with guidance and best practice Wholistic
Fostering would accept a joint portfolio ~~

Further information can be accessed through the website above and in the
Foster Carer Handbook.

### - Additional Support

Wholistic Fostering is committed to assisting Foster Carers who have
difficulties with language or literacy and who may equate expectations
in training to fragile educational experiences. The agency will discuss
and offer a range of ways that can assist Foster Carers in the
successful achievement of learning and development. This may include
peer mentoring, group sessions based on language/abilities, use of
recording devices.

Where a Foster Carer has higher level qualifications the agency will
acknowledge this.

### - Certificate of Successful completion

In supporting, guiding and signing of the individual training standards,
Supervising Social Workers will receive training and support from the
Learning and Development team and be given comprehensive guidance.

The Foster Carer will be issued with a certificate of completion upon
successful completion of the TSD Standards. Our policy is that the
Supervising Social Worker signs of the individual standards and these
are detailed in the evidence workbook. The Learning and Development team
and or other Managers will sign off all workbooks and sign the
certificates.

Wholistic Fostering is committed to checking the consistency and quality
of the work and that agency standards for training and development are
maintained. ~~In accordance with best practice internal verification
meetings are held to sample completed portfolios.~~

\</WRAP\>\|

### - Review of Progress

This will be discussed as part of the supervision agenda and schedule,
creating an opportunity to discuss progress, undertake planning and look
at if there is a need for additional support. The first annual Foster
Carer review will establish if completion has taken place or identify
reasons why not and make recommendations for remedial action. The
Fostering Panel will also consider compliance with the expectations set
out in considering continued terms of approval.

Each individual training record (CHARMS) will track achievement in the
first twelve months and beyond and detail certification.

### - Non-Completion

As an organisation and in maintaining the highest standards in training
alongside our valued Foster Carers we will always strive to assist in
the completion of this timeline. Within this we accept that there may be
a minority of Foster Carers whom may need longer than twelve months to
complete the standards and core training.

This may be for the following situations:-

-    Exceptional and unexpected personal circumstances such as
    bereavement, ill health and personal crisis.
-    Difficulties with Foster Carer's literacy/language skills
-    A significant period of time without placement
-    Complex placement issues such as disruption or allegation

This is understandable, although in accordance with best practice we
will seek to re-negotiate a timeframe for completion. This will involve
checking if circumstances can be resolved by looking at different
approaches. A proportionate, reasonable and common sense approach will
always be taken.

Where a Foster Carer is unable to complete within the timescales the
following process is followed:-

-    Supervising Social Worker discusses the circumstances with the
    Registered Manager.
-    A brief report detailing the circumstances and a copy of the
    personal development plan is sent to the Team/Registered and
    Learning & Development Team. The PDP includes proposals, actions,
    and timescales for completion.
-    The Registered Manager reviews the proposal with the Learning &
    Development team / supervising social worker and agrees a deferment
    of up to 6 months
-    Supervising Social Worker writes to the Foster Carer outlining the
    terms of deferment.

## - Annual Learning & Development (Training) Strategy

Wholistic Fostering will deliver a comprehensive training programme for
all Foster Carers, staff members and managers reflecting The National
Minimum Standards, Legislative, policy and best practice frameworks.

A Training Needs analysis will be undertaken at all levels of the
organisation which will inform the programme for the next coming year.
This will be undertaken in October (6 week completion) of each year in
order that the findings can be used to drive the new programme which
will be circulated by January 31st to begin in April.

The training needs analysis will provide the entire organisation -

-    An understanding of completed development and learning outcomes.
-    Identification of further learning and development needs for the
    organisation, management, staff team and Foster Carers.
-    Capture changing and evolving learning and development requirements
    against a fluid childcare landscape.
-    Provide an opportunity for consultation with Foster Carers, staff
    team and managers in determining learning and training goals
-    Determine the differing training needs within the organisation
-    Provide evaluation to Inform and support the differentiation of
    learning styles
-    Provide an evidence based rationale for the chosen learning and
    development strategy within the organisation.

## - The Training Programme

The agreed and chosen programme for Foster Carers will be delivered
between January and December, training will not normally take place
during the school holidays.

In reflecting the Childcare demands on Foster Carers there is a policy
commitment to where possible schedule the leaning hours between 10am and
2.30pm. There will always be exceptions to the principle set, reflecting
a greater number of learning hours for some courses. Where this is the
case there will be advanced warning allowing for planning and the
learning hour requirement will be detailed.

In acknowledging the working and personal commitments of Foster Carers
especially where this is a Second Foster Carer the training programme
will look to include weekend and evening training opportunities. These
will be detailed as such in the training programme.

**The training programme will be sent out by January 31st each year** to
all Foster Carers in electronic copy by email. **The programme of
training events will be posted on our website** and a hard copy can be
made available by the training team at the request of a Foster Carer.
All managers and supervising social workers will receive a copy.

The training programme will detail the date of the course, venue, start
and finish time, whether level 1, 2, or 3, any special learning
requirements details of Trainer/s.

## - The Chosen Training Programme

~~The training programme for the year will include where already set
dates of all 2 day preparation programmes for new Foster Carers.~~ It
will detail all the core training as referenced in section 6, Post
Approval Training for new Foster Carers. It will also include dates
where supporting workshops for the TDS Standards are taking place at the
end of the Foster Carer's group forums.

The training needs analysis incorporating training records will identify
the refresher course requirement across the Foster Carer base. Each year
the training department will collate the level of need in each refresher
title as detailed in section 6, post approval training and include the
required number of courses. In addition the core (mandatory) training,
the programme can best be understood to deliver a range of relevant
topics which are supplementary or complementary.

### - Additional Training:

Training that updates and informs Foster Carers of changes in policy,
legislation, guidance and regulations. An example would be national
changes such as the introduction of the New National Minimum Standards
Framework or legislative changes in Missing Children from Care. These
can also reflect updates in the changes in the policy of Integrated
Services Programme or perhaps changes in the policy of a local authority
that will impact directly on practice.

ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR LEARNING (APL) Accreditation of Prior Learning
(APL) is a process that enables carers to receive recognition for
courses attended and certificates and awards they already possess and
have undertaken in last 3 years prior to approval at panel.

APL takes into account:

-    Organised prior-learning where the learning has been assessed and
    where certificates are awarded on completion
-    Courses where attendance certificates are provided or attendance is
    noted on a formal continuing professional development record issued
    by a recognised organisation e.g. Local Authority, NHS,

Following approval, Carers should inform their Supervising Social Worker
of any APL that they would like to be considered and certificates or
other evidence should submitted to the Learning & Development team for
verification and if approved, will be added to the carer's individual
training record.

Some of the training will be delivered internally through the Learning &
Development team and including staff members with specialist knowledge
and an area of interest. Other topics will be commissioned externally
from individuals and organisations with expertise, knowledge and working
experience in their chosen fields.

\<del\>At times we get opportunities for places on training courses of
various local authorities and other providers through our working
partnership. Where known in advance these will be denoted in the
training programme. Otherwise they will be advertised in the
organisational newsletter (training section) shared with SSW and emailed
to Foster Carers. For an at a glance look at the approach of the
organisation to training, learning and development please see diagram
below:- \</del\>

## - Evaluation of Training, Learning & Development

The true success of any learning and development strategy can only be
judged through consistent review and evaluation. Every course will have
a brief description of the content, learning objectives and suggested
audience. The TSD standards covered will be linked.

At the conclusion of each course Foster Carers will be given a written
evaluation form and asked to share their comments on

-   the relevance,
-   learning gained,
-   quality of information and delivery.

These will be returned to the training department for consideration and
used in future planning and commissioning. An electronic option will
also be created.

They will also be given a reflective log to take away and complete for
the next scheduled supervision.

This will capture the value of learning, consider how it might be used
and assist in reflective practice.

Every Foster Carer is asked to keep this in their **record of progress
and achievement folder**. This is a positive way of demonstrating and
recording your own continuous professional development

The feedback from our Foster Carers, Children & Young People and Staff
members is afforded great value and priority as it is the barometer of
whether the learning strategy for the organisation is getting it right.

There will be other opportunities to gain direct feedback through
supervision, group forums, and organisational newsletter and by directly
contacting the training department.

The evaluations of each course will be held centrally in the training
department. Evaluations across all courses will be subject to a sampling
framework in providing an additional quality control that ensures this
is robust and is linking to the strategy moving forward.

The training policy is a central component of the commitment of
Wholistic Fostering to aspire to be a reflective and self evaluating
organisation.

## - E Learning

Wholistic Fostering has developed an internal E learning platform
available to all carers. This offers level 1 training alongside
currently a growing catalogue of other training.

The E learning will be managed by the Learning & Development team (part
of the HR team) and centrally administered by the Training
Administrator. On request carers will be issued with log in details for
the two core topics and will have up to twelve months to complete. The
learning hours for each, amount to 10 -20 hours and can be done in
sections at the pace of the Foster Carer.

This can be achieved within your own home through a home computer or
laptop and no special software is required outside of an internet
connection. The learning is secure and confidential to the learner. The
courses take the form of multiple choice questions and there are several
opportunities to review answers. The Training Coordinator can check the
status of the course completion and once completed the Foster Carer is
issued with an electronic certificate. This is printed by the Foster
Carer and will be added by a manager to your individual training record.

## - Differentiation of Learning

In understanding our Foster Carer base reflects a diversity of
experience, ability and learning style, we aim to provide training in a
format that meets these challenges.

Training will include a variety of ways to share learning including face
to face classroom based, experiential workshops, E learning options,
Peer mentoring, individual consultations, group workshops.

The training will include a range of teaching methods including
presentations, discussions, table top learning, group exercises, case
studies, scenarios, crafted role play, experiential exercises as
examples.

This acknowledges the differing learning styles (auditory, visual,
tactile, and kinaesthetic) within the target audience.

There is also a commitment to offer courses that incorporate the
principles of adult learning (acknowledgement of past experience, direct
relevance, involvement).

Some of our Foster Carers may have fragile educational experiences, find
a re connection with learning environments daunting or struggle with
issues of literacy. The training department is committed to the delivery
of individual support strategies to enable or Foster Carers access,
enjoy and benefit from training opportunities.

## - Selection and Booking of Courses & Venues

This section includes details of the process for Foster Carers in the
selection and booking of training.

By January 31st of each year every Foster Carer will receive:-

-    The training programme for the following year
-    Print out (CHARMS) of training record to date. This will identify
    due dates for refreshers! \*

### Course nomination form

The training administrator will run a mail merge and the training record
will be posted to the carer with an email to each Supervising Social
Worker and Fostering Advisor

It is recommended that the next supervision is used to discuss and
identify training needs, aspirations and areas of interest for the
coming year. This will reflect any outstanding core training, required
refresher updates, gaps in learning resulting out of placement
challenges, development of specialisms, recommendations, of Foster Carer
Review and/or Panel as examples.

This creates the personal development plan for the Foster Carer/s for
the next twelve months and is then easy to review progress. The [course
nomination
form](https://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/course-nomination-form/)
is completed and returned to the training administrator either by the
Foster Carer, Supervising Social Worker. It is emailed electronically.
It is recommended that both the Foster Carer and SSW put these dates in
their diary and they are detailed in the PDP plan.

The training Coordinator will create a **register of training** for
every individual course within the training database. On receipt of the
nomination form the TA will place the name of the Foster Carer against
the register of the chosen courses. The TA will also cross reference
refresher nominations to check dates of expiry.

Where there are minimum participant numbers (example first aid) the
training Coordinator will create a reserve list.

The **Head of Learning & Development** will assess the requirement for
additional course allocation. The Learning & Development team will
monitor course nomination returns in the first six weeks and will check
stage of progress with the SSW and provide a written report of any gaps
to the Registered Manager.

At a local level 5 days, and 1 day prior to the course, a text alert and
what\'s app reminder is sent to the Foster Carer that they are booked on
to attend the programme.

We want to make the training environment, welcoming, comfortable,
accessible and conducive to a positive learning space. Meeting all the
requirements of a diverse and geographically spaced Foster Carer base is
always going to be a challenge. As the service experiences growth and
develops it may be easier to localise the training in clusters on
occasions.

Presently Wholistic Fostering will provide the courses at our office in
Brook House.

All half day courses will provide light refreshments (coffee, tea,
biscuits) full days will include a light lunch (sandwiches).

## - Course Cancellations

The policy has detailed the importance the organisation places on
training, learning and development.

This can be costly but will receive the required investment to achieve
an outstanding approach and outcomes. Achieving 100% attendance across
our Foster Carer base is a key objective of the training strategy and
policy.

Non-attendance by Foster Carer/s can be very costly and detract from an
opportunity for someone else to benefit. There will be occasions when
the organisation will have to take the decision to cancel courses due to
unforeseen circumstances. This will always be a last resort and in doing
so the Learning & Development team will provide as full as notice as
possible, offer a clear rational and identify a replacement date as soon
as is practicable

It is an expectation of Foster Carers that if they are unable to attend
they notify the training dept as soon as is practicable. The TC will
enter this on the register of the course and on the individual training
record detailing the reason. If there is a reserve list the training
co-ordinator will notify the next person on it and offer a place. The
course register will then be amended.

It is the policy of the organisation to track non attendance and
cancellations and in the first instance inform the SSW. This will then
be explored through supervision and remedial action taken.

As an organisation and in maintaining the highest standards in training
alongside our valued Foster Carers we will always strive to assist in
the completion of the PDP

If there is a pattern of cancellation and non attendance resulting in
issues of compliance with expectations agreed in the PDP, contained in
this policy, National Minimum Standards, terms of approval as examples
then the following action will be followed:-

Within this we accept that there may be legitimate circumstances when
Foster Carers may not be able to meet all the requirements of their PDP.
This may be for the following situations:-

-    Exceptional and unexpected personal circumstances such as
    bereavement, ill health and personal crisis.
-    Complex placement issues such as disruption or allegation
-    Suspension following allegations

This is understandable, although in accordance with best practice we
will seek to re-negotiate the timescales for completion of the PDP. This
will involve checking if circumstances can be resolved and by looking at
alternative avenues of support. A proportionate, reasonable and common
sense approach will always be taken.

Where a Foster Carer is unable to complete areas of the PDP the
following process is followed:-

Supervising Social Worker discusses the circumstances with the Service
Manager.

A brief report detailing the circumstances and a copy of the personal
development plan is sent to the Registered Manager and Learning &
Development team. The PDP is adjusted to include new proposals, actions,
and timescales for completion.

Supervising Social Worker supports and monitors completion of the
revised PDP.

## - Certification and Training Records

On the day of the training, the training co-ordinator will print a
register of attendance. It is an expectation that each Foster Carer
signs the register of attendance and that this is done to evidence
attendance. The register is returned by the course leader to the
training dept.

Where the course is being delivered internally by Wholistic Fostering,
then certification will normally be issued to the Foster Carer along
with an evaluation form and reflective log at the conclusion of the
session. It is recommended that certificates and reflective logs are
kept as part of the Foster Carer's CPD folder.

On receipt of the register, the training administrator will update all
the individual training records on the (CHARMS database) This will
include completion, non completion (not completed the required learning
hours example had to leave first aid an hour early) apologies or where
no apologies. If there is a refresher requirement this will be added to
the record.

On the day of the training once the register is known the training
co-ordinator will email all SSW with Foster Carers booked to attend
details where this did not occur in order that it can be picked up in
supervision.

A **monthly report of all courses and register of attendance** is
emailed by the training co-ordinator to the **Learning & Development
team** and circulated at a local level, as part of quality assurance
compliance.

## - Qualifications & Further Learning

As part of a commitment to the continuation of continuous professional
development for our Foster Carers Wholistic Fostering are working
towards offering and funding opportunities for further learning and
qualification where appropriate.

We aim to support the Foster Carer of each household with achieving the
Level 3 Diploma for the Children and Young People's Workforce (replacing
NVQ 3 Caring for Children and Young People)

This is a nationally recognised qualification in the field of childcare
which splits into two pathways Early Learning & Childcare (fostering
route) and Social Care. Vocational in nature this can be completed at
your own pace up to 14 months duration. It is made up of some mandatory
units and optional choices allowing you to study areas of interest. We
commission the programme at a local level to you.

This can also be achieved through an Advanced Apprenticeship Children's
Care and Learning Development.

Either option will eventually be open to all Foster Carers within 2
years of first approval but requires completion of the TSD standards,
all core training and a record of completion of the required number of
additional courses. This is something that can be discussed through
supervision and form part of your PDP.

An alternative qualification might be the BTEC Level 3 Advanced skills
for Foster Carers aimed at Foster Carers who prefer a more academic E
Learning route which is less vocational in nature.

BTEC Level 4 Advanced Practice in Working with Traumatised Children an
opportunity to undertake a practice based E learning qualification over
two years exploring the approaches and techniques involved in a
therapeutic based approach to parenting

There should never be a ceiling to CPD and there may be Foster Carers
who would like to continue on their learning and qualification. The
training policy will set out a pathway that enables requests and
applications to be considered on individual merits. It may be that the
organisation fully or part funds alongside the Foster Carers/s

Short Courses each agency will need to see if this is relevant and
personalise to their agency

In developing the service, there will be a number of opportunities to do
short based courses; some accredited, others certificated in a number of
areas. These can be valuable ways of increasing knowledge and specialism
inclusive of recognised certification, whilst providing a challenging,
informative and dynamic learning experience.

## - Additional Resources/information portal

In supporting learning and development Wholistic Fostering have made a
variety of [learning
resources](https://thrive.wholisticfostering.co.uk/archives/category/learning-resources)

## - Celebrating Achievement

In supporting the training, development and learning of our Foster
Carers, we deeply value the contribution, priority, motivation and
energy they invest in their self development in the interests of
improving the care to and life chances of the young people and children
in our service.

This takes dedication, an investment of time alongside all they provide
to children and young people and whilst at times can be exhilarating it
can also be a challenge. Wholistic Fostering wants to take opportunities
to recognise and celebrate the achievements of our Foster Carers through
a number of ways:-

-    Sharing them with the whole organisation through the **newsletter**
-    Holding presentation evenings where all the family, other Foster
    Carers and families and staff can share in the recognition of the
    Foster Carer's achievement. ie. End of year dinner
-    Writing to acknowledge success
-    Informing our stakeholders, commissioners and partner organisations
-    Inclusion on our website

## - Involvement of Young People and Foster Carer\'s Children

Wholistic Fostering aim to achieve these objectives:-

1.  Where appropriate and something a young person wants to do, to
    include them in the development and delivery of training for Foster
    Carer's. This may be through direct teaching, video presentation,
    shaping materials, sharing life experience.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Offering opportunities where appropriate and relevant to young
    people to attend training such as the first aid qualification. We
    will endeavour to offer training and developmental opportunities
    through workshops, activities, camps and materials to the children
    of Foster Carer's in understanding, exploring and coping with the
    challenges of fostering. **The training calendar will promote and
    detail events aimed at the children of Foster Carers.**

## - Review of this Training Policy

This is not a stand alone document and integrates in to the current
suite of policies and procedures that inform guide and determine the
practice of the agency. An **annual report** will be produced by the
Head of Learning and Development for the service for the Registered
Managers and wider audience of the whole organisation.

The actual policy is subject to review lead by the Head of Learning and
Development and in consultation with the Management, Staff and Foster
Carers of Wholistic Fostering.

Any changes will be presented and ratified through the Head of Learning
and Development prior to implementation.
