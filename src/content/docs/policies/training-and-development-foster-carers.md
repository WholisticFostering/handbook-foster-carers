## 🧭 Introduction

This policy explains how Wholistic Fostering supports the training and
development of our foster carers. It reflects the National Minimum
Standards for Foster Care and the Training, Support & Development (TSD)
Standards.

We believe well-supported and trained foster carers are key to offering
safe, high-quality care to children and young people.

## 🎯 Our Commitment

Wholistic Fostering is committed to:

-   Providing quality learning opportunities from the point of
    assessment onward.
-   Supporting foster carers to meet and exceed the TSD Standards.
-   Offering ongoing learning that responds to the needs of each child
    and carer.
-   Making training accessible, practical and responsive.

## 📚 Training for Newly Approved Carers

All newly approved foster carers must:

-   Complete the **TSD Standards Workbook** within 12 months of approval
    (or 18 months for connected persons).
-   Attend induction training, including **Safeguarding**, **Safer
    Caring**, **First Aid**, and **Recording**.
-   Have a personal development plan (PDP) that is regularly reviewed in
    supervision.

## 🔄 Ongoing Training & Development

Carers are expected to:

-   Attend core and specialist training throughout the year.
-   Update skills in key areas such as behaviour management, child
    development, and trauma-informed care.
-   Maintain a training log and review training needs in their annual
    foster carer review.

## 🧑‍🏫 Learning Opportunities

Training is available in different formats to suit learning styles and
availability:

-   Face-to-face workshops
-   Online modules
-   Support groups and peer learning
-   One-to-one learning during supervision

## 📝 Personal Development Plans (PDPs)

Each carer will have a PDP, developed with their Supervising Social
Worker. This plan outlines training needs and tracks progress.

PDPs are reviewed at:

-   Supervision sessions
-   Annual foster carer reviews
-   Following placement changes or significant events

## 🤝 Support to Complete Training

We understand foster carers have busy lives. We offer:

-   Flexibility around training sessions
-   Online access to resources and tools
-   One-to-one support from Supervising Social Workers
-   Guidance on meeting TSD requirements

## 🏆 Recognition and Standards

We value and celebrate carers who:

-   Meet and maintain the TSD Standards
-   Participate in advanced or specialist training
-   Share learning with peers and contribute to our support network

## 🔍 Monitoring and Review

We regularly review:

-   Training attendance and completion
-   Impact of training on placement outcomes
-   Feedback from carers about training quality and accessibility

Training performance feeds into carers\' annual reviews and supports
decisions around continued approval and matching.

## 📌 Summary

Training is not just a requirement --- it's part of our promise to
support you in offering the best care possible. We are committed to
helping every foster carer grow in knowledge, skills and confidence.
