title: 📋 Interim Business Continuity Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-27
---


This interim policy ensures Wholistic Fostering can continue operating
in the event of an emergency or disruption --- even with our limited
staffing and resources.

It provides a short-term plan for leadership succession, critical
functions, and communication. A full Business Continuity Plan will
follow as the agency grows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** To maintain essential operations during unexpected
disruptions using practical interim measures.

**Scope:** This policy applies to all [staff, volunteers, and key
stakeholders](/staff/start). It outlines temporary contingency plans for
leadership and critical tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👥 Key Personnel

-   **Director/Registered Manager** -- Patricia Nettleford
-   **Operations Manager / Responsible Individual** -- Michael Dennis
-   **Agency Decision Maker (ADM)** -- Nicole Richards

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔁 Interim Leadership Succession

If either the Director or Operations Manager is unable to fulfil their
duties:

-   The **Agency Decision Maker (ADM)**, a qualified social worker, will
    assume their responsibilities.
-   The ADM will have full authority to make decisions required to
    maintain safe operations and compliance.
