title: Quality Assurance Framework
---


## Introduction

Information about the quality of the Wholistic Fostering Service comes
from a number of different

sources. For example, a key source of information is feedback from
fostering families and from children and young people looked after in
foster placements. Case audits are another source of information about
the quality of the Fostering Service. This framework identifies the
various different sources. It also describes the process by which this
information is drawn together and the themes identified including what
is working well and also what needs improving.

      - Quality Assurance information from a variety of sources
      - Fostering Quality Assurance Meeting
      - Service improvement action plan implemented

## Sources of Quality Assurance Information

### Case Audits

There are four types of audit:

      - The Self Check Audit is to be completed by the Supervising Social Worker or the FSW during file days. This audit requires a check of both paper files and Charms.
      - The Supervisor Audit helps to frame the discussion about the work being undertaken in the carer household and ensures management oversight of any documents, decision records, risk assessments etc that need to be in place. The primary source of information in this audit is <font 12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Charms</font> .
      - The Quality Audit is done once per year at or before a review (purely from <font 12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Charms</font> ) and will give more qualitative information to the services and recordings.
      - The Foster Carer Assessment Audit is completed by the Fostering manager who signs off each foster carer assessment before it is presented to the Panel.

In advance of the Fostering Quality Assurance (QA) Meeting the themes
from audits will be collated into a brief summary. It is an opportunity
to identify good practice as well as areas for improvement. This is not
to identify issues in individual cases (which should be addressed
directly with the practitioner in supervision) but to identify wider
organisational themes and issues.

## Foster Panel feedback

The Fostering Panels provide quality assurance feedback to Wholistic
Fostering Team on the quality of reports being presented to the Panel.
Panel members complete the Foster Panel Document and QA Forms. Copies
are sent to the Registered Manager.

There is also an evaluation form for Fostering Social Workers and Foster
Carers to provide their feedback on their experience of attending the
Panel (the Foster Panel Evaluation Form).

The feedback from the Fostering Panel is collated into a report which is
presented to the QA Meeting.

## Foster Carer views

The Foster Carer Consultation Group is in development and will meet
regularly.

Feedback from the Foster Carer Consultation Group may be sought as and
when it is needed on any particular issue or when issues are raised by
the group. For example, the group have raised awareness of needs for
particular training and support.

The group will also actively contribute to developing processes and
practice within Wholistic Fostering including sitting on interview
panels for new members of staff / Fostering Panel members.

Foster Carers will also be consulted as part of the Foster Carer Review
Process. Their views \<font
12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>will be collated and
reported to the QA Meeting.\</font\>

# Foster Carer exit interviews

A month after any foster carer resigns, they are offered an exit
interview. The outcome \<font
12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>of these is recorded on
Charms. The views of resigning foster\</font\> carers\<font

collated and\</font\> \<font

Assurance Meeting.\</font\>

## Views of children and young people who are fostered

• Consultations with looked after children for Foster Carer Reviews are
to be collated and presented to the QA Meeting

## Views of children who foster

The Children Who Foster group is a group of children and young people
who are the \<font 12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>sons and
daughters of foster\</font\> carers\<font
12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>and which is in development.

## Fostering Quality Assurance Meeting

The Fostering Quality Assurance (QA) Meeting provides the forum to:

      * Bring together the themes and trends identified in the above reports relating to good practice and to areas where there is a need to improve service quality.
      * Formulate an action plan which addresses service gaps or deterioration in performance or quality as well as maintaining and extending examples of good practice.
      * Monitor the actions identified to improve services.

The Fostering QA Meeting provides a quarterly forum for Wholistic to
undertake a review of the

Fostering Service on the basis the quality assurance information
described above.

The Responsible Individual collates the information from the sources
above for the Meeting.

The themes identified in the reports from the above sources will be
discussed at the meeting. An action plan will be produced which
addresses service gaps or deterioration in quality as well as good
practice and how to maintain and extend it. The action plan will provide
a standardised way to address these issues, providing appropriate
direction to staff.

The action plan will identify where additional guidance, training,
briefings or other forms \<font
12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>of staff development are
needed to ensure that service standards are maintained or\</font\>
\<font 12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>improved.\</font\>

The QA Meeting will be attended by Responsible Individual / QA Officer;
Regeistered Manager and Business Manager.

## Implementation of action plan and feedback to staff

Feedback from the QA Meeting can provide staff with consistent and
appropriate messages about the priorities of Wholistic Fostering.

Key areas for improvement should be identified to staff at Team Meetings
and areas of good practice should be highlighted and followed up by the
Registered Manager in supervision.
