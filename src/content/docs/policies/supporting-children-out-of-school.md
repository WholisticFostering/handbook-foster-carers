title: 📋 Supporting Children Out of School Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-03

Foster children often face educational challenges due to instability,
exclusion, or lack of support. This policy outlines the responsibilities
of foster parents in promoting consistent education, ensuring children
are happy in school, and helping them fulfil their potential.

## 🎓 Why Education Matters

Children in care can experience disrupted schooling, lower achievement,
and reduced confidence. Barriers include:

-   Frequent moves and school changes
-   Limited advocacy
-   Exclusions
-   Low expectations
-   Poor information-sharing between services

**Foster parents play a vital role** in removing these barriers and
helping children thrive.

## ✏️ Your Role as a Foster Parent

Foster parents are expected to:

-   Attend all educational meetings -- including PEP, SEN, and parents'
    evenings
-   Help children with transitions between schools or into college/work
-   Support with reading, homework, and out-of-school learning
-   Ensure punctual, regular school attendance
-   Maintain strong communication with teachers, parents and social
    workers
-   Promote ambition and confidence
-   Provide uniforms and school essentials (funded via allowances)
-   Create a quiet, dedicated homework space with computer access (age
    8+)
-   Keep school absences (outside illness) to a strict minimum -- always
    discuss with the social worker first

## 🚫 School Exclusions

If a child is excluded from school:

-   Inform the social worker and your supervising social worker
    immediately
-   Record the absence in the daily log
-   Request homework from school if exclusion is less than 7 days
-   Structure part of each day around learning while excluded
-   Work with the child's social worker to provide support and advocacy
-   If needed, discuss options for additional support -- such as
    temporary respite, day care with another foster carer, or funding
    for educational activities
-   All financial support for exclusion-related activities must be
    pre-agreed with the social worker

## 📌 Final Notes

Foster carers should work closely with the local education team.
