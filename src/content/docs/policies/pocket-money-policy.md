title: 💰 Pocket Money and Savings Policy
---


## 📌 Purpose and Scope

This policy sets out guidance for the allocation of pocket money and
savings for children and young people in foster care, based on a
percentage of the carer\'s weekly allowance. The aim is to strike a
balance between encouraging responsible spending and fostering
consistent savings habits, while allowing flexibility to meet each
child\'s individual needs.

\*Note: Many Local Authorities have their own specific pocket money
policies. Where applicable, those requirements must take precedence.\*

## 💸 Standard Allocation

Pocket money and savings should normally be set at **10% of the carer's
weekly allowance**. For example, if the weekly allowance is £200, a
total of **£20** would be allocated between pocket money and savings.

Carers have discretion to split this amount according to the child's age
and needs, provided both elements are included. The following table
provides a **recommended split**:

  Age Range        Pocket Money   Savings
  ---------------- -------------- ----------------------
  0 -- 4 years     Up to 10%      Remainder as savings
  5 -- 10 years    Up to 20%      Remainder as savings
  11 -- 15 years   Up to 40%      Remainder as savings
  16 -- 18 years   Up to 60%      Remainder as savings
  18+ years        Up to 80%      Remainder as savings

These percentages reflect the growing need for personal spending as
children mature, while maintaining a foundation of regular savings.

## 🎯 Principles

-   Pocket money and savings should be consistent and predictable for
    the child.
-   Carers are expected to make sure savings are clearly tracked and
    accessible to the young person when they move on or leave care.
-   The arrangement must be clearly explained to the child or young
    person, adapted to their age and understanding.

## 🔄 Adjusting the Split: Young Person\'s Choice

Where a Looked After Child (LAC) or young person strongly expresses a
preference to receive more of the allowance as pocket money, **the
Supervising Social Worker (SSW)** can agree to override the recommended
split.

The following **maximum pocket money percentages** apply in these cases:

-   **Up to 75%** of the allocation for young people under 18
-   **Up to 95%** for young people aged 18 and over

Any increase must be based on a discussion with the young person about
the importance of saving for their future. The SSW should ensure:

-   A clear rationale is recorded
-   The young person signs a short declaration confirming:
    1.  They understand the long-term benefit of saving
    2.  They are choosing to receive more pocket money, and this may
        impact their savings for the future

## 🧾 Record Keeping

Carers must:

-   Keep a basic written record of savings and pocket money
-   Include any significant purchases or changes in pattern
-   Be prepared to share this record during visits or reviews

## 📌 Summary

This policy ensures children and young people are supported to develop
financial awareness, with flexibility for individual circumstances. It
protects a minimum level of savings and promotes informed choice as
young people grow older.
