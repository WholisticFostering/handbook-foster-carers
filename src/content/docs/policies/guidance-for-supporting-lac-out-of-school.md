# Supporting children out of school

**National Minimum Standards for Fostering 2011 - Standard 8 promoting
Educational Achievement**

The learning and educational needs of each child or young person in
foster care must be given a high priority and encouragement and support
must be provided to enable them to gain their full potential.

Foster children always have difficult lives and their educational
performance can be poor as a result of the instability of their
circumstances.

Wholistic Fostering has a collective responsibility to address the
barriers to education which exist for children in foster care.

These barriers include:

      * Lack of effective advocacy
      * Lack of stability due to moves and school changes
      * Prolonged periods of exclusion
      * Low expectations
      * Failure of services to share information

Everything possible needs to be done to ensure that foster children are
happy in school, that they are not bullied and that they are able to
take part in activities which they enjoy. All of these should help build
self-esteem.

Foster Parent(s) are the key to breaking down barriers by valuing and
supporting the education which children receive. They are expected to
help assess the child's education and progress, to aid the planning and
review process and assist in personal education plans.

Prioritising education must include:

      * Attending all meetings to do with education, this includes parent’s evenings, PEP meetings, SEN meetings and other meetings relevant to the child’s education and progress.
      * foster parent(s) are expected to support children and young people through the process of transferring educational provision, for example moving from primary to secondary and on to further education. This will include attending registration and assisting a child or young person with any application to further education or employment.
      * Regularly helping children with reading
      * Ensuring regular and punctual attendance at school
      * Supporting and encouraging children to do homework and out of school activities
      * Liaising with parents, school, designated teachers and social workers on major decisions related to school work and any social or school problems
      * Having high expectations and communicating this to children to help them build confidence and reach their potential
      * Providing necessary uniform and school equipment, the cost of which will be covered by fostering allowances or extra payments (in some cases only)
      * Providing a quiet space to complete homework with priority access to a computer for all children over the age of eight
      * Liaising and co-operating with the looked after children education support team
      * Keeping to an absolute minimum the number of days that a child is absent from school due to holidays or other events. Always discuss the need for these with the social worker and obtain their permission before making arrangements for absences for reasons other than illness or medical appointments.

### Guidance for foster parent(s) on Exclusion from school

The local education authority's policy for inclusion should ensure that
all foster children have equal opportunities and access to education.
For the majority this should be a full time place in an educational
establishment which meets their needs. However, a child may be excluded
from school temporarily or permanently.

In cases where the foster child is excluded the following procedure must
be complied with:

      - The foster parent(s) must inform the child’s social worker and record the absence in the young person’s daily record or diary and they must also inform their supervising social worker
      - Wholistic Fostering seek to ensure that young people have effective advocacy and support and their foster parent(s) may be the best person to provide this. However, this should be planned in liaison with the social worker.
      - For Foster children excluded for less than seven days attempts should be made to receive homework from their school, and this should be done in the first instance by their foster parent
      - Children excluded from school should be expected to spend part of every day doing structured homework that is provided in liaison with the school.
      - School exclusions put extra stresses on the parent and can threaten the stability of a placement. In every case, Focus Fostering will give consideration to providing extra support to the parent during school hours, it the pressure on the placement is hard to manage. This could be day care with another foster parent or extra financial support for organised activities to be planned taking into account the needs of the young person and their foster family.
      - Provision of finance for organised activities needs to be discussed with the social worker to decide if it is necessary.
