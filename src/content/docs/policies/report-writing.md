## Anonymous Persona\'s

As part of our safe guarding commitment All our reports will contain
substituted codenames when identifying looked after children and young
people in our reports.

The process for constructing an anonymous code are set out below.

      - Take the first initial of the forename and surename ie Matthew Jones = **MJ**
      - Append with the last two numbers in the year of birth ie 1999 = **99**
      - Append with the first letter of their gender ie. Male - **M** 

The code in the examples used above would be **MJ99M**

In our reports the young person\'s name is substituted with the code.

## Data Encryption

All of our sensitive data stored in our infrastructure whether that be
emails, reports our on our web servers feature a strong level of
encryption implementation.
