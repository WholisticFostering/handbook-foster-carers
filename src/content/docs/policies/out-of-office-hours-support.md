Wholistic Fostering provides **24/7 out-of-hours support** for all
approved foster carers. This means that during evenings, overnight,
weekends, and public holidays, there will **always be a member of staff
available** to support you.

This support is for carers, children and young people in placement, and
local authorities who need urgent contact outside standard office hours.

### 🧭 When to Use Out-of-Hours Support

Foster carers should call the duty officer in situations such as:

-   🕊️ Death of a child or young person in placement
-   🏥 Serious illness, accident, or self-harm
-   💊 Overdose, substance misuse, or suspected exploitation
-   🚨 Police involvement or arrest
-   🏃 Child missing or absent without authorisation
-   ❗ Serious behavioural incidents
-   💬 Allegations or suspicions of abuse
-   🧭 Any urgent matter affecting the carer's ability to provide care

*Not sure if it's urgent? If in doubt, call. It's better to check than
delay support.*

### 🕔 Out-of-Hours Availability

-   📆 Monday--Friday: **5pm to 9am**
-   🕐 Weekends & public holidays: **24 hours**

-   🚨 **Emergency contact (Registered Manager):** 07551 122332

### 👥 How the Service Works

-   A Wholistic staff member is on-call and can offer **telephone advice
    or arrange a visit** if necessary
-   Any home visits are approved and supported by the manager
-   If the on-call worker is on leave, the **Registered Manager** takes
    responsibility for cover

### 📝 Recording and Follow-Up

Every call to the out-of-hours service is logged and followed up:

-   The call is recorded, noting the concern, action taken, and
    follow-up tasks
-   The record is shared with the manager and relevant supervising
    social worker
-   Records are stored in:
    1.  the child's file
    2.  the carer's file
    3.  the out-of-hours record book

### 🔁 Coordination with Local Authorities

Each local authority responsible for a child also has its own
out-of-hours team. Foster carers should **notify both Wholistic and the
local authority** as needed for significant incidents.
