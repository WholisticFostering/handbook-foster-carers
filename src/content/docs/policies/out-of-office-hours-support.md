title: Out-of-Office-Hours Support
---


Wholistic Fostering provides 24 hours out-of-hours support for all
approved foster carers, therefore should a foster carer, child or young
person in placement or local authority need to contact the agency during
the evenings, at weekends and during public holidays there will always
be a member of staff who is on duty available.

Foster carers should remember that the local authority responsible for a
child/young person placed each have their own out of hours services who
will also need to be notified of certain incidents.

The staff member on duty for Wholistic Fostering will usually have
details (names, addresses and telephone numbers) of existing foster
carers and of all children/young people in placement and will be aware
of current issues in each placement

The out of hours 'duty officer' should be contacted in the following
instances.

      * Death of a child/young person placed
      * Serious accident or illness to a child/young person
      * Any incident of self-harm, overdose, alcohol/drug abuse
      * A child/young person is absent without authorisation or has run away from the placement.
      * A child/young person is/ has alleged abuse
      * A child/young person is behaving/has behaved in an explosive and angry manner and the foster carer is unable to contain/manage the situation
      * Any incident which requires the police to be called out to the foster carer’s home’
      * Any incident of a child/young person being arrested in connection with alleged offences
      * Any suspected involvement of the child/young person in prostitution
      * Any serious incident/event in the life of the foster family which impacts upon the capacity or suitability to continue with a placement/or fostering in general.

*This list is not exhaustive and foster carers, if uncertain about
whether a situation is serious enough to call the out of hours 'duty
officer', it is always better to err on the side of caution and call.*
