title: Children and Young People's Participation
---


## Introduction

Everyone involved in the receipt and delivery of services should be
consulted about decisions which may affect them.

This includes children, their parents, other significant family members
and those charged with providing the service; including managers, staff,
carers and professionals or colleagues from other agencies.

This means that people\'s views should be sought and taken into account
in relation to all decisions, which are likely to affect their daily
life and their future.

Consultation should take place on a regular and frequent basis with
those who need to be consulted and assumptions should not be made about
the inability or lack of interest of those who should be consulted.

Consultation should be carried out with children in a form they will
understand in either their preferred language or an appropriate method
of communication. If as a result of the consultation change is not
possible or is restricted for whatever reason, steps should be taken to
ensure those affected and involved are informed of decisions as soon as
practicable after they are made, and an explanation for the decision
given. Methods of consultation may include postal surveys, group
discussions or exit interviews.

## Children and Young People\'s Participation

Participation of children and young people in decisions about their
lives is an essential part of growing up and if done well it enhances
children's safety and well­being and improves services designed to
support and protect them. To be done well it requires a commitment at
all levels of an organisation to reflect on and promote. This includes:

-   Positive attitudes to children and young people;
-   Skills at communicating;
-   Appropriate resources;
-   Commitment to developing services which support children's
    participation.

Wholistic Fostering recognises that the quality of care that young
people receive will affect their life chances more than anything else.
Furthermore, that the service it provides will be enhanced by listening
attentively to the information provided by young people.

Wholistic believes that the young people placed in its care will be more
knowledgeable about what happens within the caring environment than many
of those who look after them. Prior to their admission they will (in the
main) have experienced a variety of different caring environments and
styles of parenting.

It is therefore very important that we are communicative with them and
our stakeholders. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child stresses very clearly that children have a right to have their
views heard on decisions that affect their lives. To this end, through
its quality assurance systems the Agency will endeavour to take
children\'s views seriously.

This means that young people will be helped to understand why they have
been placed with foster parents, and be supported and involved in their
Care Plans. They will be helped to understand their rights, to make
choices and to consider all options available to them.

Throughout a child or young person\'s stay with foster carers work as a
team with the Agency and other professionals, all of whom contribute to
the care planning of each young person.

It is important that young people\'s views are sought about their
progress and the care that they are receiving, so prior to each
Statutory Review, foster carers encourage young people to contribute to
the reports that are prepared about them.

Consultation should take place on a regular and frequent basis and
assumptions should not be made about the inability or lack of interest
of those who should be consulted.

Where people have communication difficulties, of any sort, suitable
means must be provided to enable them to be consulted; including access
to advocates or representatives who may speak on their behalf.

Consultation should be undertaken in a creative manner.

If action following consultation is not possible or is restricted, for
whatever reason, steps should be taken to ensure they are informed of
the decisions as soon as practicable thereafter; an explanation should
be given and the person involved given the opportunity to make a comment
and express their views.

If decisions are made against people\'s wishes, they should be informed
of the decision and the reasons for the decision should be explained. In
these circumstances, the person should be informed of any rights they
have to formally challenge the decision, for example by way of a
Complaints or Grievance Procedure.

Wholistic will ensure that children have access on a confidential basis
to independent advice and support from adults who they can contact
directly about problems and concerns, at a level which is appropriate
for their age and understanding. Children are informed of their rights
to advocacy, and of how to access an advocate or contact the Children\'s
Commissioner.

## The Role of the Manager

Managers must ensure that staff and carers have the time and resources
available to them to ensure the effective participation of children and
young people. This includes:

-   Using supervision to consider issues relating to the voice of the
    child in on­going cases;
-   Review complaints or concerns raised by children and young people
    and what actions have been taken to address these;
-   Review compliments to build on these;
-   Consider how representative issues raised by children and young
    people are in relation to such issues as gender, culture, sexuality
    and disability;
-   Ensure processes designed to gather issues raised by stakeholders
    including children and young people are in place and are routinely
    being used, reviewed and assessed for their impact;
-   Ensure processes are in place to provide feedback to stakeholders
    including children and young people what changes have been made and
    if not why not.

Unless otherwise stated in specific procedures in this manual, it is
assumed that people working in this organisation will take reasonable
steps to keep their Managers informed of their actions; and will consult
and seek their approval where they do not have decision making
responsibility delegated to them.

In order to facilitate this, Managers must ensure that effective lines
of communication are established and maintained.

If procedures in this manual require that Managers are informed within
specified timescales or their approval is sought before actions are
taken, this must be complied with.

## Consultation With Stakeholders

In addition to the views of the child, Wholistic will gather similar
information from parents and other \"significant others\" in the
child\'s life, social workers and commissioning bodies.
