title: 🗣️ Children and Young People's Participation
---


Participation is about making sure that children and young people have a
voice in the decisions that shape their lives. Wholistic Fostering
believes that meaningful involvement improves wellbeing, strengthens
care planning, and helps build confident, informed young people.

## 🌟 Why Participation Matters

Children and young people are experts in their own lives. Listening to
their experiences, views, and wishes isn\'t just respectful --- it\'s
essential for good care and better outcomes.

Wholistic Fostering is committed to:

-   Creating a culture where children are \*actively\* listened to
-   Involving them in decisions that affect their care and daily life
-   Ensuring participation is accessible, meaningful, and
    age-appropriate

## 🧒 What Participation Looks Like

Participation means more than simply asking questions. It includes:

-   Explaining why they are in foster care and what their rights are
-   Involving them in their Care Plans and everyday decisions
-   Supporting them to contribute to reviews and meetings
-   Helping them understand options and make informed choices
-   Providing access to advocacy and confidential support

📌 **Note:** Children and young people may have experienced multiple
placements or different parenting styles --- they often know more than
we realise about the system around them. That insight should be valued.

## 💬 How We Consult Children

Consultation should be:

-   **Regular** -- not just at reviews or when problems arise
-   **Accessible** -- using language and formats that work for each
    child
-   **Genuine** -- where views are taken seriously, not tick-box
    exercises
-   **Creative** -- using drawings, stories, exit interviews, or group
    chats

If decisions are made that go against their wishes, we explain why ---
and let them know how to raise concerns or challenge outcomes through
complaints or advocacy.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Advocacy & Independent Support

Wholistic Fostering makes sure children:

-   Know their rights
-   Have access to independent advice and advocacy
-   Can speak to someone outside of their placement if they feel unsafe
    or unheard

Children are given age-appropriate information on how to access an
advocate and how to contact the Children's Commissioner.

## 👩‍💼 Role of the Manager

Managers play a key role in embedding participation across all practice.

They must:

-   Use **supervision** to explore how the child's voice is reflected in
    decisions
-   Review complaints, compliments, and patterns in children\'s feedback
-   Ensure carers and staff have time and resources to engage children
    properly
-   Monitor whether issues raised reflect the diversity of our young
    people
-   Put systems in place to show children how their feedback leads to
    change --- or why something couldn\'t be changed

## 🤝 Working With Stakeholders

In addition to hearing from the child or young person, we also:

-   Seek views from parents, family members, and other significant
    adults
-   Regularly consult with social workers and placing authorities
-   Reflect on feedback from exit interviews and placement reviews

Participation is everyone's responsibility --- not just a tick-box, but
a way of being.
