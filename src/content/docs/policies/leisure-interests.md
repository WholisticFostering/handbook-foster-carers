Fostered children should be encouraged to enjoy hobbies, develop their
skills, and join in with fun and age-appropriate activities --- just
like any other child.

## 📘 What the Standards Say

Under **Regulation 16** of the Fostering Services (England) Regulations
2011, carers must promote children's leisure interests.

**National Minimum Standard 7** expects that:

-   Children live in a stimulating environment
-   They\'re supported to take part in school and out-of-school
    activities
-   Carers make day-to-day decisions as a **reasonable parent** would,
    within the child's placement plan

'Children have permission to take part in age appropriate peer
activities\... within the framework of the placement plan.'

This includes:

-   School trips and clubs
-   Sports, arts and hobbies
-   Overnight stays or holidays with friends and family (unless care
    plan says otherwise)

**Note:** DBS checks are \*not normally required\* for carers\' friends
or relatives if the child remains formally placed with their approved
foster carer. (Children Act 1989 Guidance, Vol 4, Paragraphs 3.22--3.23)

## 🎯 What We Expect of Foster Carers

Carers are supported to:

-   Encourage and facilitate leisure activities
-   Make everyday decisions confidently and appropriately
-   Talk with the child's social worker if any uncertainty arises
-   Reflect on leisure access and participation during supervision

## 📊 How We Monitor This

Leisure activity is tracked through:

-   [📈 Outcomes Tracker](/policies/outcomes_tracking)
-   Child Feedback Forms
-   Foster Carer records and supervision sessions
