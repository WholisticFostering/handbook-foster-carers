title: 🗃️ Maintaining, Storing & Accessing Records
---


Wholistic Fostering keeps clear, accurate records to support our work
with foster carers, children and professionals. This policy explains how
records are kept, who can access them, and how requests are handled
fairly and lawfully.

### 📁 What records do we keep?

We securely keep:

-   Records of each foster carer and their household
-   Records of each child placed with us
-   Casework and supervision notes
-   Key documents like placement plans, safer caring, health and
    education plans

Records may be digital, paper-based or both.

### 🔒 How are records stored?

-   All records are stored securely, in line with data protection law
-   Paper files are kept in locked cabinets; digital records are stored
    using secure, encrypted systems
-   Access is limited to authorised Wholistic staff and professionals
    with a need to know

### 🧑‍⚖️ Legal framework

We follow the **UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018**, which give
people the right to access personal information held about them, unless
limited by one of the exemptions (see below).

### 👁️ Who can see records?

A person has the right to see personal information held about them. This
includes:

-   Foster carers (about their own file)
-   Children or young people (about their own file)
-   Parents/carers, in some cases where appropriate
-   Representatives (e.g. solicitors), with written consent

### 🚫 When can access be limited?

We may withhold parts of a record if:

-   It would seriously harm someone's physical or mental health
-   It includes information about someone else, and their identity can't
    be safely removed
-   It is part of a legal investigation or proceeding
-   The record was provided in confidence by a third party

In all other cases, records will be shared openly and honestly.

### ✍️ How to request access

To request your records:

-   Send a written request to your supervising social worker or
    Wholistic's Data Lead
-   Proof of identity will be required (e.g. passport, driving licence)
-   We will respond within **one calendar month** (as required by UK
    GDPR)
-   If information is withheld, we will explain why

### 🧒 Requests by children

Children have the same rights to access information as adults. We will
always:

-   Assess whether a child has enough understanding to make the request
-   Support the child to view or understand the information
-   Involve a parent or advocate if needed and in the child's best
    interest

Children are encouraged to comment on their records or add their own
views.

### 🧍 Requests by others

Requests may also come from:

-   **Parents** --- where in the child's best interest
-   **New fostering agencies** --- with foster carer's written consent
-   **Representatives** --- such as solicitors, with evidence of
    permission
-   **Someone acting on behalf of a deceased person** --- assessed on a
    case-by-case basis

### 🧾 Can information be changed or corrected?

If someone believes information about them is incorrect:

-   They can ask for it to be corrected or erased
-   We will consider the request and respond with a decision
-   Where agreed, records will be updated promptly

### 📓 Encouraging openness

We encourage open sharing of information at every stage:

-   Carers should be given copies of key documents (e.g. assessments,
    agreements)
-   Children should be involved in age-appropriate ways in their records
-   We aim to respond informally to simple requests wherever possible

### ❌ Refusing access

If we must refuse access:

-   The decision will be made by the Registered Manager
-   The person will be told why, in writing
-   A record will be kept of the decision and reasons

They have the right to appeal to the **Information Commissioner's Office
(ICO)** or seek a court order.
