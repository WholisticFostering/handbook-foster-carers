Wholistic Fostering believes that everyone --- children, carers,
families, and professionals --- should feel safe and supported in
raising concerns or complaints. We are committed to resolving complaints
quickly, fairly, and respectfully.

This policy complies with:

-   Fostering Services National Minimum Standards 2011 -- Standard 1,
    21, and 25
-   Children Act 1989 Representations Procedure
-   Ofsted and Regulatory Authority guidance

📌 For complaints about the decisions of the Fostering Panel, see: [🧾
Representations / Independent Review
Procedure](/policies/representations-independent-review-panel)

## 🙋 Who Can Make a Complaint?

A complaint can be made by:

-   A child or young person
-   A parent or family member
-   A foster carer
-   A professional involved with the service
-   Any individual receiving services from WF
-   Anyone acting on behalf of another person with a legitimate interest

Children will be supported in making complaints in ways that suit their
age and understanding. Staff and carers are expected to actively support
this.

Anyone can withdraw a complaint at any time.

## ⚠️ What Can Be Complained About?

Complaints may relate to:

-   The quality or delivery of service
-   The actions or behaviour of staff or carers
-   Failure to provide a service
-   Unfair treatment or discrimination
-   Decisions made by WF that impact on a person's wellbeing or rights

Serious complaints will be reported to the Regulatory Authority
(Ofsted).

If a complaint relates to a **Care Plan or Placement Plan**, the matter
should be raised with the child's **social worker** and/or **Independent
Reviewing Officer**.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Getting Help to Complain

Support may be provided by:

-   A foster carer or Supervising Social Worker
-   A parent or social worker
-   An Independent Visitor or Advocate
-   The child's Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO)

WF carers can also access advocacy through FosterTalk.

## 📋 Stages of the Complaints Procedure

WF encourages resolution at the earliest possible stage, but all
complaints are taken seriously. Complainants may start at any stage if
appropriate.

### 1️⃣ Stage One: Informal Resolution

-   Handled by the Fostering Manager.
-   A meeting or discussion is arranged after receiving the complaint.
-   A written response (letter of outcome) will be provided, explaining:
    1.  Who handled it
    2.  What was investigated
    3.  What decision was made and why

### 2️⃣ Stage Two: Formal Investigation

If unresolved at Stage One --- or the complainant prefers to escalate
directly:

-   A written complaint should be sent to the **Director** of WF.
-   An **Independent Investigating Officer** is appointed within 5
    working days.
-   A full investigation will take place.
-   A written report is sent outlining the investigation and findings.

### 3️⃣ Stage Three: Independent Review Panel

If unsatisfied after Stage Two:

-   A request must be made in writing to the Director, with reasons.
-   An **Independent Complaints Panel** will review the case within 28
    days.
-   The Panel includes at least:
    1.  A Fostering Panel member
    2.  A Board Director
    3.  A senior staff member
    4.  An independent individual
-   The complainant receives a written outcome within 7 days of the
    review.

If still dissatisfied, the complainant may contact **Ofsted**.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Allegations: Standards of Care

This section applies when a carer\'s practice is questioned (e.g.,
inappropriate discipline, unsafe care).

### Investigation Steps

-   Managed jointly by the child\'s social worker and the carer's
    Supervising Social Worker.
-   Carers are informed in writing about:
    1.  The allegation
    2.  Who is involved
    3.  Their rights and available support (e.g. FosterTalk)
    4.  Impact on current placements and financial arrangements

-   Investigations assess the event, carer's conduct, reporting,
    training needs, and support requirements.

### Outcomes

-   Carers are notified in writing of the outcome.
-   If necessary, approval terms are reviewed under the Foster Carer
    Review Procedure.
-   Panel involvement and possible deregistration may follow serious
    concerns.
-   Consideration is given to reporting to **Ofsted** and the
    **Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS)**.

## ⛔ Termination of Approval

-   The Service Manager decides whether to **suspend** the carer during
    investigation.
-   If termination is recommended:
    1.  A full report is presented to Panel.
    2.  The **Agency Decision Maker** decides final outcome.
    3.  Carers are offered 28 days to appeal.
    4.  If safeguarding concerns exist, referral to the **DBS** may be
        made.

## 🚫 Resignation During an Investigation

-   Resignation does not stop an investigation.
-   Any concerns are reported to responsible Local Authorities and
    Panel.
-   The new agency (if applicable) will be informed.

## 💷 Financial Implications

-   Payments **continue** if children remain in placement during the
    investigation.

    handbook.

    possible.

complaint handling. If a complaint is made against the **Responsible
Individual** or **Registered Manager**, an **external party** will be
appointed to handle it fairly and transparently.
