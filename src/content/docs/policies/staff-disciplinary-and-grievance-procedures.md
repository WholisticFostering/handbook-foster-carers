At Wholistic Fostering, we aim to support a safe, respectful and fair
working environment for all. This includes a clear and consistent way to
address concerns about conduct or performance, and to raise or respond
to grievances.

These procedures apply to all staff, foster carers and professionals
working with us.

## 📜 Legal & Regulatory Standards

These procedures are based on:

-   **The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011**, Reg. 21
-   **National Minimum Standard 25.9**
-   **Employment Act 2008**

Key requirements include:

-   A disciplinary process that allows for suspension if needed to
    protect children's welfare
-   Reporting concerns about abuse or neglect is mandatory -- failure to
    do so is a disciplinary matter

## ⚠️ What Is Disciplinary Action For?

Our disciplinary process supports:

-   Setting clear expectations for conduct and performance
-   Helping people improve where needed
-   Protecting children and young people
-   Avoiding serious disputes and legal action

Examples of misconduct:

-   Unprofessional behaviour (lateness, refusal to follow reasonable
    instructions)
-   Harassment, bullying or creating a hostile environment
-   Misuse of agency property (e.g. phones, internet)
-   Criminal behaviour (e.g. theft, assault)
-   Failing to report a safeguarding concern

## 📋 Disciplinary Process

We always aim to resolve concerns fairly and sensitively. If formal
disciplinary action is necessary, the process may involve:

-   🔸 **Written warning**
-   🔸 **Formal meeting** (with management or panel)
-   🔸 **Appeal hearing** before a final decision

Each case will involve a **full investigation** before decisions are
made.

**Outcomes** may include support plans, warnings, suspension, or
dismissal --- depending on the situation and risks involved.

## 💬 Grievance Procedure

Everyone has the right to raise a concern if they feel they have been
treated unfairly or inappropriately. This includes experiences of:

-   Harassment or bullying
-   Discrimination
-   Unfair treatment
-   Unsafe or unprofessional working conditions

Examples of harassment:

-   Offensive jokes, emails or social media posts
-   Unwelcome physical contact or gestures
-   Exclusion, isolation, or unfair workload changes
-   Pressure to behave inappropriately

## 🛠️ Dealing With Grievances

**1. Try Informally First**

-   Speak directly to the person involved if safe to do so
-   Or raise the concern with your line manager
-   Often, things can be resolved quickly this way

**2. If That Doesn't Work -- Raise Formally**

-   Let your manager (or Registered Manager) know you want to raise a
    formal grievance
-   A meeting will be arranged -- with everyone involved or separately,
    as needed
-   A decision will be made fairly and in writing within **14 days**

In serious cases, someone may be **suspended temporarily** while
concerns are addressed.

## 🧾 Summary

Wholistic Fostering promotes a fair and respectful culture. These
procedures help:

-   Protect children and young people
-   Support and guide staff and carers
-   Handle concerns clearly and consistently

Any questions? Please speak to your line manager or the Registered
Manager.
