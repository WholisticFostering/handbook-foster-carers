## Introduction and Underpinning Regulations and Standards

\<WRAP center round info 60%\> The Fostering Services (England)
Regulations 2011 regulation 21 requires a fostering service to operate a
disciplinary procedure in relation to employed staff which, in
particular:

-   \(a\) provides for the suspension of an employee where necessary in
    the interests of the safety or welfare of children placed with
    foster parents,
-   \(b\) provides that the failure on the part of an employee to report
    an incident of abuse or neglect, or suspected abuse or neglect, of a
    child placed with foster parents to an appropriate person is a
    ground on which disciplinary proceedings may be instituted.

National Minimum Standard 25.9 requires the fostering service to supply
staff, volunteers and foster carers with a copy of 'the policies and
working practices in respect of grievances and disciplinary matters'.
\</WRAP\>

Our agency has specific procedures in place for dealing with
difficulties which may arise as part of the working relationship from
either the employers or employees/carers/professionals perspective.

They are necessary to ensure that everybody is treated in the same way,
issues are dealt with fairly and reasonable and that the agency as an
employer is compliant with current legislation and guidelines.

The important provisions governing discipline and grievances at work
area currently to be found within the Employment act 2008 and the
Employment Tribunals (Constitution and rules of procedure) (amendment)
regulations 2008.

Disciplinary procedures are needed to :

-   Make employees aware what is expected of them in the terms of
    standards of performance or conduct and

the likely consequences of continued failure to meet those standards

-   Identify obstacles to individuals achieving the required standards
    (i.e. training needs, understanding of job

requirements, additional support needed)

-   Enable employers and employees, carers or professionals to agree
    goals and timescales for improvements
-   Try to resolve matters before going to a employment tribunal
-   Act as a point of reference were the issue to be taken to an
    employment tribunal or complaint made Conduct

Employee, carer or professional misconduct could range from continued
lateness, being intoxicated, failure to follow reasonable management
instructions, abuse of organisations telephone and internet provision,
bullying behaviour or creating hostile environment through theft,
fighting and committing criminal offences.

Stages of Process

If disciplinary action is to be taken, it will be given in three stages:

-   A formal letter (written warning)
-   A formal meeting with committee and staff involved
-   An appeal hearing before final decision

There will always be a fair and thorough investigation to determine all
facts and to decide if further action is necessary.

Potential outcomes

At Wholistic, due to the nature of the service we provide to children
and young people and our community, it is at our discretion the result
of any outcome following a disciplinary.

## Two forms of Handling grievances

**Informally**

At our agency we will try our utmost to resolve any grievance within the
setting, with individuals concerned being encouraged to discuss with the
manager informally and come to an amicable agreement and appropriate
actions being taken to prevent further grievance.

**Formally**

If after informally trying to resolve the grievance, an individual still
wishes to make a more formal Grievance, a meeting with management and
those involved will be held, either with both parties or separately.

It will be down to the managers, including the Registered manager to
make a formal decision upon how to resolve the situation.

All actions or decisions will not be made lightly and we will consider
both parties fairly before a decision is made.

In some circumstances there may be need to issue a staff suspension
until the issues are resolved.

The managers have 14 days to make a formal decision on the matter.
