title: 🔚 The End of the Placement
---


## 🎯 Overview

This policy explains what should happen when a child's placement with
foster carers ends, whether it ends as planned or unexpectedly. All
endings should prioritise the wellbeing of the child and aim to be as
positive and stable as possible.

## 📅 Planned Endings

A planned ending occurs when the placement purpose has been met or needs
to be revised. Placements may end with the child:

-   Returning home to their family
-   Moving to another placement
-   Returning home with respite support
-   Leaving care to live independently
-   Ending early due to placement disruption

Wherever possible, transitions should follow the child's care plan and
happen in a thoughtful, supported way. Carers may stay in touch with
children after placement, with agreement from the placing authority.

### 👋 Saying Goodbye

When a planned ending happens, carers should:

-   Talk to the child about why the move is happening
-   Reassure the child if the move is not due to their behaviour
-   Discuss future contact with the child, if appropriate
-   Involve the foster family in saying goodbye
-   Ensure the child's life storybook, photos, and keepsakes are packed
-   Check all personal documents are handed over (e.g. passport, birth
    certificate, savings)
-   Include any medications
-   Help the child pack belongings with dignity (using proper bags or
    suitcases)
-   Prepare the placement paperwork for the social worker
-   Let the social worker know if you\'re happy to speak with the next
    carer

## ⚠️ Unplanned Endings

Unplanned endings are difficult for everyone. If things aren't going
well, it's important to ask for help early.

### 🆘 What to Do

If you're struggling to continue the placement:

-   Speak with your Supervising Social Worker as soon as possible
-   Avoid requesting immediate removal unless it is a serious emergency
-   Consider options such as respite, additional support, or specialist
    help
-   If the placement must end, give as much notice as possible

### 🛠️ Placement Stability Support

To prevent disruption, WF may offer support through:

-   Stability Meetings
-   Temporary respite care
-   CAMHS referrals or therapy
-   Reduced expectations around routines

With time and support, many placements can recover and continue
successfully.

## 🌀 Disruption Meetings

If a long-term placement ends unexpectedly, a Disruption Meeting may be
held. The meeting allows everyone to:

-   Reflect on what happened
-   Share views on support received
-   Learn from the experience
-   Identify the child's future needs
-   Support the foster family

Disruptions are rarely due to one factor alone. Some placements fail due
to unrealistic expectations, mismatched needs, or challenges that
weren't fully understood. Children often test carers, especially early
on. With open communication and support, difficult starts can turn into
successful placements.

## 🤝 Keep Talking

If you have any concerns---big or small---speak to your Supervising
Social Worker. Early conversations can prevent breakdowns and help
everyone stay supported.
