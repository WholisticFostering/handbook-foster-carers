title: 🏠 Occasional Working from Home
---


Occasionally working from home can be beneficial for both staff and the
agency. This policy outlines when and how such arrangements may be
considered. It applies to short-term or infrequent home working---up to
20% of a working month.

## ✅ When It\'s Appropriate

\* Home working is suitable for tasks that don\'t require direct
supervision or constant interaction with others. \* It must not be used
as a substitute for childcare. \* You must remain available and
contactable during agreed hours.

Requests should be made to your line manager.

## 💡 Benefits of Home Working

\* Flexible working time \* Reduced travel stress and costs \* Fewer
distractions, better focus \* Improved recruitment and retention

## 👥 Responsibilities

Both staff and managers have shared responsibilities:

**For employees:**

-   Complete your own workstation and safety assessments
-   Maintain confidentiality and data security
-   Report any issues promptly

**For managers:**

-   Assess suitability of the employee and the task
-   Confirm agreement terms in writing
-   Forward copies to head office for the personnel file

## 🔐 Security & Confidentiality

All information handled at home must remain secure:

\* No family or friends should access work documents \* Confidential
files must be stored safely \* Digital security (e.g. anti-virus) must
be maintained

## 🛠️ Health & Safety

You\'re responsible for maintaining a safe workspace at home:

\* Conduct a workstation risk assessment (Display Screen Equipment
compliant) \* Keep wires tidy and equipment in good condition \*
Hazardous substances must never be taken home

For regular home working, contact your manager to review suitability.

## ⚠️ Stress Awareness

Home working can help reduce stress but may also increase isolation or
lead to overwork. Keep communication open with your team and line
manager. Prolonged remote working is discouraged for this reason.

## 📋 Legal & Tax Considerations

\* Inform your home insurance provider if using work equipment at home.
\* Complete a Loan of Equipment form for any agency equipment. \*
Exclusive work use of a room may have Capital Gains Tax implications.

## 🧪 Suitable Tasks

Home working is typically suitable for:

\* Independent written or administrative tasks \* Projects with
measurable objectives \* Minimal dependency on team input

## 📑 Application Process

1\. Make a request to your line manager. 2. If approved:

     * Health & Safety and workstation checks are completed
     * Clear work expectations are set
     * Communication arrangements are agreed
     * Both sides retain the right to end the agreement
