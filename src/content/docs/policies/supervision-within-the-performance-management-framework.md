title: Supervision within the Performance management Framework
---


The supervision process is a key part of the performance management
framework:

//\...a process in which one worker is given the responsibility by the
organisation to work with another worker(s) in order to meet certain
organisational, professional and personal objectives (Morrison, 2001).
//

Supervision is an on-going process that takes place in many different
settings and must be capable of adapting to the different needs of the
agency's employees and to help employees develop in their professions
over time.

## Formal Supervision

Formal supervision should take place at planned **monthly** meetings.
The frequency may be increased (fortnightly) for new employees, newly
qualified social workers, social workers with difficult case loads and
employees returning to work.

Supervision should contribute to the development of a learning culture
by promoting an approach that develops the confidence and competencies
of managers and of people who work directly with children, young people
and their foster families. Supervision is at the core of individual,
team and service professional development.

Supervision is a shared commitment by both the supervisor and supervisee
and should be viewed as a priority. It should only be cancelled in an
emergency and with the agreement of both parties. If it is agreed that a
supervision session should be cancelled, it will be the supervisor\'s
responsibility to rearrange a new session.

The Supervision Policy applies to all employees (full time, part time,
temporary, permanent, and agency. All supervision sessions should be
recorded and signed by the supervisor and supervisee.

Emphasis given to the content of meetings will vary according to the
needs of the supervisee. There should be an agreed agenda and
preparation on behalf of both parties. Supervision provides time for
employees to reflect on their practice, consider feelings and values,
link theory to practice, consider the impact of learning in practice and
take a pro-active role in decision making, and problem solving. The
supervisee and manager are provided with the opportunity to review case
loads, individual cases and to plan and record strategies. This
information is recorded in the supervision notes. Decisions, suggested
interventions, plans and any other information relevant to the child,
young person and foster family must also be recorded.

## Informal, unplanned/\"ad-hoc\" Supervision

It is important for managers to recognise the value of an open door
policy in order for employees to raise and resolve immediate issues that
cannot wait for formal supervision meetings. Day to day working will
involve a level of work related communication and employees should
ensure that they inform their line manager of any serious concerns in
relation to their work.

Informal supervision should not replace the planned monthly supervision
session. Informal supervision may take place at the manager\'s
discretion due to the urgency of presenting issues or where there is a
need to be explicit to avoid any potential ambiguity or
misunderstandings. \*\*Any decisions as a result of informal discussions
made must be clearly recorded. \*\*

## Group Supervision

The registered manager may considered the use of group supervision where
it is desirable to involve a group of employees; all involved in the
same task, meeting with a supervisor to discuss issues about their work
or the way they work together as a team. The benefits of group
supervision include learning from each other and the promoting
consistency. Please note this does not replace individual monthly
supervision.

## Supervising Students on Placement

Anyone supervising a student on placement must hold a practice teacher
award \"or have demonstrated their competencies against national
standards\" (Social Work Task Force Report, p23, 2009).

## Newly Qualified Social Workers (NQSW)

Regularly planned high quality supervision is an integral part of the
inaugural year of a newly qualified social worker. It is recommended
that supervision is provided twoweekly for the first three months
reducing thereafter to the recommended monthly supervision. Time should
be allocated to focus on the achievement of the NQSW Outcome Statements.
Supervision records must be kept for auditing, to monitor case work
management, workload access to training and development and to assess
progress over the year (recommendations from the SWTF Report 2009,
pending future guidance).

The NQSW programme ensures that new social workers receive time and
funding for training, regular supervision and a programme of induction,
support and development. New social workers will be expected to receive
regular and supportive supervision. This level and quality of
supervision is expected to continue as they engage in the Post
Qualification process within the first two years of their appointment.

## Appraisal, Learning and Development

**Appraisal** - an annual meeting (six monthly review), with the aim of
discussing performance over the last year, celebrating achievement,
review performance against relevant professional occupational standards,
agree new objectives, evaluate learning that has taken place and
identify future learning and development needs. Records of appraisal
meetings may be used for reference at supervision meetings..

**Learning and Development** - supervision provides an opportunity to
ensure employees have the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out
agreed tasks:

      * Updating training in line with guidance, legal requirements and professional role;
      * Supporting continuing professional development and identifying new learning needs as they arise;
      * Identifying ways to meet those learning needs such as shadowing, e-learning and  training
      * Reflective discussion on evidenced based practice and research;
      * Supporting Newly Qualified Social Workers;
      * Building confidence and enhancing competence;
      * Discussing career development.
