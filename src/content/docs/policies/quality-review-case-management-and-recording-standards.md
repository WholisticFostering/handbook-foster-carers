title: Quality Review -- Case Management and Recording Standards
---


Case management is an integral part of social work supervision system.

This must include the supervisor reading, auditing and signing the case
file at regular intervals. Supervisors should be satisfied that written
records meet good standards and sign and date records they have
monitored (

Where supervision case records are recorded on paper or electronic files
they must be retained for access for at least 2 years and then archived.

When allocating a case the manager must ensure that the employee is
clear as to what has been allocated, what action is required and how
that action will be reviewed and supervised (Recommendation 53, Lord
Laming).

Senior managers should inspect, at least once every three months, a
random selection of case files and supervision notes (Recommendation 30,
Lord Laming).

      * Reviewing of Case management meetings may be held separately. 
      * Records will be maintained and these may be used to link with supervision meetings to enable overall performance and development needs to be reviewed;
      * Whenever possible supervision should be carried out by the same supervisor to build a relationship based on trust and openness;
      * If a supervisor is absent from work for a long period (over one month) the supervisor's line manager should ensure that effective arrangements are in place for the supervision of staff

Various methods, other than formal one to one sessions, are outlined
below; they have a place but cannot and should not replace planned,
formal, recorded one to one sessions.
