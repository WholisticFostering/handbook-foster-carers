## 👪 1. Treating Children as Family

Children in your care should be treated as part of your family. This
includes transport. You are expected to transport them just as you would
your own children.

✅ A **first aid kit** and **fire extinguisher** must always be in your
vehicle. ✅ Always take a first aid kit when going on outdoor trips or
activities.

## 🔒 2. Seatbelts & Car Seats

The law requires everyone in a vehicle to wear a seatbelt or the correct
restraint. Here\'s what that means for different age groups:

  -------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------

  -------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------

**Important reminders:**

-   Always use the right car seat, even for short journeys.
-   The harness should fit snugly --- you should only be able to slide
    two fingers between the chest and the strap.
-   Only use **EU-approved** seats (look for an 'E' in a circle).
-   Deactivate front airbags before fitting a **rear-facing baby seat**
    in the front.

## 🚙 3. Vehicle Safety

Your vehicle must:

-   Be roadworthy.
-   Have a valid **MOT** (if required).
-   Be insured to cover children in foster care.

Your **Supervising Social Worker** will check your documents during
regular Health & Safety checks.

## 🧸 4. Managing Travel with Children

✅ Bring books, toys or devices for longer trips. ✅ If you need to stop
(especially on the motorway):

-   Use hazard lights.
-   Move everyone safely away from the vehicle and road.
-   Call emergency services.

**Male carers:** Avoid travelling alone with a child if possible. If it
can\'t be avoided, the child should travel in the **back seat**. If two
adults are present, the child is usually safest in the **front seat**,
not between adults in the back.

## ♿ 5. Mobility Allowance

Some disabled children may qualify for a **mobility allowance** under
Section 17 of the Children Act 1989.

If you think a child in your care may be eligible, speak to their
**Social Worker**.
