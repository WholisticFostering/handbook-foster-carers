title: 📝 Recording & Record Keeping
---


### 🔍 Scope and Purpose

Recording is a key part of safe and effective foster care. It protects
children and carers, supports planning, and preserves memories. This
policy outlines what records must be kept, how to keep them, and who can
access them.

### 📚 Legal Framework

Relevant legislation includes:

-   The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 -- regs 22, 30--32
-   Children Act 1989 Guidance & Regs
-   Data Protection Act (UK GDPR)
-   National Minimum Standards 26

### 📁 Types of Records We Keep

-   Case records for each foster carer
-   Case records for each child
-   Register of foster carers
-   Register of children placed
-   Personnel and training records
-   Incident, accident & health logs

### 🤐 Confidentiality

All records are kept securely. Only those who need the information to
support a child or carer will have access. Never share a child's
personal details with those who don't need to know --- including
friends, neighbours, or extended family.

### 📖 Carer Daily Recording

Foster carers must complete:

-   📆 Daily logs for each child
-   📒 Appointment diary
-   🗓️ Monthly summary

These should include key events, contact, behaviour, achievements,
health, education, and any concerns. Record both positives and concerns.

### ✍️ How to Record

-   Keep entries clear, simple, and factual
-   Use EFORMS - an electronic system provided by Wholistic Fostering
-   Record events as soon as possible
-   Avoid jargon or abbreviations
-   Quote the child's words where relevant

### 🕐 When to Record

Daily or as close to the event as possible --- especially for:

-   Accidents or incidents
-   Contact visits
-   Health matters
-   Behavioural concerns or achievements
-   Police involvement or missing episodes

### 🧒 Life Story Work & Memory Boxes

You'll help preserve a child's story by keeping photographs, notes on
milestones (e.g. birthdays, first words), and other memories. These are
important for a child's identity and future wellbeing.

### 🗃️ Secure Storage & Return

All paper records must be stored securely (e.g. locked cabinet). All
records must be returned to Wholistic when a child leaves. Digital
records must be deleted.

### 👁️ Access to Records

Children and carers have the right to request access to their records.
This can be done through the Registered Manager. Requests are usually
answered within 30 days.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Carer Records

We maintain a full record for each carer, including:

-   Application and assessment reports
-   Training, supervision, and reviews
-   Placements and incidents
-   Complaints or allegations

### 🧾 Schedule 2 Register Records
