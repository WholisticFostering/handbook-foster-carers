title: Administration of Medication and First Aid
---


## Scope

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 6 Promoting Good Health and
Wellbeing.

## Home Remedies

Home Remedies are medicines, suitable for children, which can be bought
\'over the counter\' without prescription, including Paracetomol.

Foster carers must seek advice and guidance in relation to the
management and administration of medication and this will be done
together with the prescribing doctor whether this is a GP or a hospital
consultant/Doctor.

### Aspirin

Although Aspirin may be purchased \'over the counter\', without
prescription; it may not be given to children unless prescribed by a
medical practitioner.

### Other Home Remedies

Other Home Remedies may only be given to a child with the consent of the
parent (which should be recorded in the Placement Agreement/Placement
Plan) WF recognise that this may not always be possible to obtain an
therefore in such circumstances liaise with the child's social worker.
Home Remedies may be given if the child is over 16 years of age, or
having consulted the child\'s GP to ensure that no adverse reactions may
result.

Home Remedies must be kept in a locked cabinet that is only accessible
to the foster carers, unless a child is permitted to keep his/her own
Home Remedies, in which case the arrangements for this must be set out
in the Placement Agreement/Placement Plan.

Home Remedies, other than Paracetomol, should only be given for a
maximum of 48 hours. If the symptoms persist beyond that time the child
should see a medical practitioner before further dosages are given.
However, if Paracetomol is given for 24 hours and the symptoms still
persist, the child should see a medical practitioner before further
dosages are given.

Where children are deemed not to be capable of administering Home
Remedies themselves, care must be taken to ensure they consume the
product as required, in the presence of a foster carer.

## First Aid

Fully equipped First Aid boxes must be kept in each home and in each
vehicle used to carry children. The Supervising Social Worker for the
foster carers must ensure that suitable arrangements exist to keep First
Aid boxes equipped.

Children may administer their own First Aid if they have a suitable
First Aid certificate or under the supervision of a certified carer.

If children are not deemed to be capable of giving First Aid themselves
or under supervision, a certified carer must administer it.

## Child Health Record & Monitoring Administration of Medication

### Administration of medicines

The following steps must be followed when administering medication:

Check the medication to ensure that it is prescribed for the child in
question and it is within the expiry date.

Ensure that the child's name, the name of the medication, and the dosage
instructions are correct, and that the dosage has not already been
administered.  Establish how the medication is to be administered.

Record each administration of the medicine including the date, time,
dosage, balance, the carer's name and signature.

Record the refusal or non-administration of medicine including the
reason why. Please view the \'[Child Health Record and Monitoring
Form](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp05-child-health-record-monitoring/)
here.

### Receipt of Medicines

All medicines brought into the home from whatever source, including
discharge medication from hospital, medicines prescribed in an acute
situation as well as medicines prescribed on a regular ongoing basis or
those brought from another home, should be recorded.

The record should show:

      * Date of receipt
      * Name, strength and dosage of medicine
      * Quantity received
      * Expiry date
      * Name of the child for whom medication is prescribed/purchased.
      * Signature of the carer receiving the medicines.

### Disposal of Medicines

To provide a full audit trail of medicines, a record is required to
identify a removal of the medication from the home. This record should
detail the following:

      * Date of disposal/return to pharmacy
      * Name and strength of medicine
      * Quantity removed
      * Name of the child for whom the medicine was prescribed/purchase
      * Signature of the carer who arranges disposal of medicine

## Medical Emergencies

If a child is at risk or requires First Aid/Medical attention, carers
should apply first-aid procedures if it is safe to do so, and notify
their Supervising Social Worker as soon as possible. However, carers
must not compromise or delay the process of getting medical help by
doing so. If in any doubt, call medical help.

If there is a risk of serious harm or injury, or the carers are unable
to manage safely, the Police should be notified.

Foster carers should always assess the situation and in a medical
emergency, send for medical help and an ambulance. Before assistance
arrives:

      * Do not move the person
      * Try to clarify why the emergency has occurred
      * Collect any drug samples or spillages (e.g. vomit) for medical analysis
      * Do not induce vomiting
      * Keep the person calm, under observation, warm and quiet
        * If the person is unconscious:
          * Ensure that they can breathe and place in the recovery position o Do not move them if a fall is likely to have led to spinal or other serious injury which may not be obvious
          * Do not give anything by mouth o Do not attempt to make them sit or stand
          * Do not leave them unattended or in the charge of another child
      * For needle stick (sharps) injuries:
      * Encourage wound to bleed. Do not suck.
      * Wash with soap and water. Dry and apply waterproof dressing o If used/dirty needle, seek advice from doctor

When medical help arrives, pass on any information available, including
vomit and any drug samples.

No further action, beyond making the situation safe and attempting to
confiscate harmful drugs or substances, should be taken without
authorisation from the Supervising Social Worker or an agency manager,
preferably in consultation with the relevant child's social worker.

## Recording Accidents and Illnesses

First Aid and records of all medicines that have been administered will
be recorded within the daily recording and the child health monitoring
form mentioned above; if advice is sought from a General Practitioner or
pharmacist, carers are supposed to include details of the discussions
within the summary as confirmation. If an accident occurs, (which
results in a visit to GP/hospital,) it is recorded within the carer's
records and on the [accident/illness record
form](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp08-accident-form/)
that is supplied to all WF Foster Parents.
