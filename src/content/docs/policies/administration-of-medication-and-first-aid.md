This policy ensures all children and young people receive safe,
appropriate first aid and medication support --- in line with fostering
regulations and National Minimum Standards (Standard 6: Promoting Good
Health).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🩺 Home Remedies

\* Foster carers must always seek advice from a doctor before giving
**any medication**, including over-the-counter remedies. \* **Aspirin**
must not be given to children unless specifically prescribed. \* **Other
home remedies** (e.g., cold/flu products) may only be given:

-   With parental consent recorded in the [Placement
    Plan](procedures/placement-plans)
-   Or, if unavailable, following consultation with the child's social
    worker

\* Remedies must be kept in a **locked cabinet**, unless a young person
is permitted to self-administer (and this is recorded in the plan). \*
Dosage limits:

-   Paracetamol -- max 24 hours without medical advice
-   Other remedies -- max 48 hours without advice

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧰 First Aid

\* A stocked **First Aid Kit** must be kept in the home and car. \* The
**Supervising Social Worker** checks arrangements during visits. \*
First aid must be given by a certified carer or under their supervision.
\* Children may self-administer minor first aid only if trained and
agreed in their plan.
