We maintain a handbook for all personnel.

## Underpinning Regulations and Standards

It is implicit in NMS standard 24 that fostering services should
maintain and issue a personnel handbook: '24.1 The employer is fair and
competent, with sound employment practices and good support for all its
staff and volunteers. 24.2 All staff, volunteers and the registered
person are properly managed and supported and understand to whom they
are accountable.'
