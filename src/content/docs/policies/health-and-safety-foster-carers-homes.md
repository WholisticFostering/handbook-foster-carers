title: Guidance for social workers on completing health and safety assessments on foster homes
---


This paper provides fostering social workers, Fostering Panel members
with a framework within which to consider health and safety issues when
considering an assessment of a potential foster carer and when carrying
out a review of the carer's approval.

Assessing and supervising social workers should satisfy themselves that
each individual applicant's/carer's accommodation is suitable to enable
the applicant/carer to provide safe and stimulating care. In reaching
such a decision, a number of factors will need to be taken into account,
not least the age, gender and numbers of children proposed to be
fostered.

What may be appropriate for someone who is proposing to foster one baby
for pre-adoptive placements may not be appropriate for someone who is
proposing to care for teenagers through to independence. These
guidelines should therefore be considered afresh for each new
application/review rather than applying a rigid minimum standard for all
applicants/carers.

Panel members should ensure that they are satisfied with any steps taken
to address issues raised by the health and safety assessment and that
any risks identified have been minimised to the extent that the foster
home provides a safe environment for children. It is hoped that
assessment will not be bought to Panel where major health and safety
issues are still outstanding.

The agency decision-maker will also need to be satisfied that the
assessing social worker and Panel have considered the relevant issues
arising from this guidance for each application/review.

      * Statutory framework
      * Wholistic Fostering’s Policy
      * Health and safety assessments for potential foster carers
      * Health and safety assessments for existing foster carers
      * General guidance

## Statutory framework

Fostering services are required by regulation 26 of the Fostering
Services Regulations 2011 to obtain the information listed in Schedule 3
of these regulations before considering whether the applicant is
suitable to act a foster carer and that their household is suitable for
any child in respect of which approval may be given. This includes
details of the applicant's accommodation.

The National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services require that the
home and immediate environment are free of avoidable hazards that might
expose a child to risk of injury or harm and contain safety barriers and
equipment appropriate to the child's age, development and level of
ability (Standard 10).

Standard 10 requires that the foster home is inspected annually to make
sure that it meets the needs of foster children.

Standard 10 requires that fostering services have a comprehensive health
and safety policy in place.

References are made to other relevant standards at appropriate points
throughout this document.

## Wholistic Fostering's policy

WF is committed to ensure that any looked after child or young person
will be placed in a foster home that has been assessed and approved to a
standard that is safe for children and young people to live in. These
standards should conform to nationally recognised safety standards

Wholistic Fostering is also committed to ensure that social work staff
who are involved in fostering arrangements are sufficiently experienced
and competent to make a professional judgement in connection with the
placing of children and young people in a caring home environment.

Social work staff will ensure that approved foster carers fulfil the
expected competency to provide a safe, healthy and nurturing environment
(Standard 10).

The assessing social worker will gather evidence to satisfy the
fostering panel that the prospective foster carer has 'an ability to
ensure that children are cared for in a home where they are safe from
harm or abuse' (Competency 2.1).

Supervising Social Workers will inspect the foster home annually to
ensure it can comfortably accommodate all who live there and that it
meets health and safety standards (Standard 10).

Supervisory visits to the foster homes will satisfy us that homes are
warm, adequately furnished and decorated and maintained to a good
standard of cleanliness and hygiene (Standard 10).

The process will ensure:

      * every child placed will have their own bed and the accommodation arrangements will reflect the child’s assessed need for privacy and space or for any specific need resulting from a disability (Standard 6.4).
      * the child has their own room unless shared with a same sex sibling of appropriate age and has been assessed as safe to do so (Standard 6.5).
      * the foster home and immediate environment are free from avoidable hazards that might expose a child to risk of injury or harm and contain safety equipment appropriate to the child’s age, development and level of ability (Standard 10).

WF is committed to provide the foster carers with adequate preparation
and training which will cover health and safety issues. The carer will
also be provided with written guidelines which outline their health and
safety responsibilities (Standard 10).

Where the foster carer is expected to provide transport for the child,
the Department will ensure this is safe and appropriate to the child's
needs

Foster carers are made aware they may be interviewed or visited
periodically as part of the Commission's inspection process

WF has produced an assessment format to be used at the time of a carer's
home health & safety audit. This will be completed by
assessing/supervising social workers at the following times:

      * during the assessment of potential carers, prior to the application to Panel, a copy of the completed health and safety assessment form must be attached to the completed Form F.
      * when carrying out the annual review of the carer’s approval, confirmation that the carer’s health and safety assessment form continues to be suitable must be entered on the annual review form.
      * whenever a carer moves house or carries out major structural works or other changes to their existing property and its immediate environment.
      * where there are major changes to the immediate environment surrounding the home, for example new building works or the creation of a new road (in such circumstances it will only be necessary to complete the relevant sections of the assessment).
      * Whenever the carer changes their car (in such circumstances it will only be necessary to complete the relevant sections of the assessment).

## Carer's Accommodation

A Foster Carers home must be an environment where children can develop
and grow in a safe and healthy way. Carer's accommodation must be homely
and nurturing.

It is not the expectation of WF that Carers to maintain their homes in
'showroom condition' nor should the carers' properties be 'palaces'. All
things being equal, children will usually identify better in homes and
areas that reflect where they have been raised.

Foster Carers are responsible for ensuring that their home is a safe and
healthy environment for the children they look after. Equally as
important is the need for the home to feel warm and have a nurturing
atmosphere, this can be difficult to quantify but is something most
people can associate with.

**A Foster Carers' approval is at risks if at any stage they fail to
meet the standards set out in this policy.** However, it is important
for WF to be notified of any shortfalls to enable an accurate and up to
date risk assessment to be conducted. Such an assessment could put
measures in place to reduce the risk.

WF appreciates that there will be times when home improvements need to
be undertaken. However, any repairs or improvements must be undertaken
in a way which does not compromise children's safety and appropriate
measures need to be in place for more major building works. Please seek
guidance from your SSW.

The following minimum requirements must be met at the Carers' main home
and any secondary residences.

### Property

All homes used for fostering should be in a generally good state of
repair, be warm, welcoming and friendly. They should be environments
where children are safe, feel safe and one which promotes their
emotional and physical well being. Age appropriate books, games and toys
should be available to children within the property.

The numbers of children that the home can accommodate must take into
consideration any existing household members, any likely changes to the
household i.e. children returning from university, and the homes overall
ability to accommodate everyone. This means not just looking at the
number of bedrooms, but the size of communal areas of the house as well
including the number of toilets, showers and bathrooms. It may even be
as basic as asking if the dining table can seat all the household
members at the same time.

When making judgements on accommodation the Welfare Principle will be
the deciding factor on the outcomes of the decision made.

### General

The home should be clean and free from hazards appropriate to the
expected ages of approval.

      * There should be no obvious health and safety issues (health and safety checks must be up to date and all recommendations carried out subject to the carers categories of approvals)
      * All furniture should conform to fire safety regulations.
      * The house must have fitted and working smoke alarms which are regularly tested (advice with free supply and fitting can usually be obtained from your local fire service).
      * Gas Central Heating boilers must have an annual service certificate from a Corgi registered fitter.
      * Homes with Gas appliances must be fitted with a serviceable carbon monoxide detector.
      * Carers must be contactable and able to easily communicate with the outside world. If no land line or internet phone is present in the home, their mobile phones must be able to have a good reception whilst in the home, but it is an expectation of WF that all foster homes have land line or internet phone.
      * There should be space in the home for children’s private study (this can be in their own room, a study or a quiet corner where they can concentrate).
      * All areas of the home must be well lit and maintained at a reasonable temperature.
      * All areas of flooring are in good condition and free from hazards e.g. no torn flooring and trip hazards.
      * All electrical appliances must be safe and in good repair.
      * Carers who smoke will not be approved to provide care for babies and children under the age of 5 yrs.
      * Foster Carers must inform their insurance companies they are or intend to be Foster Carers. They must insure they have appropriate cover.
      * There should be internet access for children to assist with education and learning

### Children's Bedrooms

      * Each child placed must have their own room (except in the case of sibling group placements as detailed below)
      * Foster children must not share bedrooms with birth children
      * Siblings of the same sex, under the age of ten, may share a suitable sized bedroom.
      * If a bedroom is designated as suitable for siblings to share, an appropriate risk assessment is conducted prior to the placement of the children.
      * Separate beds must be provided for all children. Bunk beds may be used for 4- 10 year olds, with suitable safety guards.
      * The child/young person’s needs for privacy are to be respected and there is adequate space and facilities for this.
      * Bedrooms should be of a reasonable size and appropriately furnished with suitable wardrobe and cupboard space and should be child focused

### Kitchens

      * Carers are responsible for the health and welfare of their looked after children. This extends to their dietary needs and in doing so food must be prepared, cooked and stored in a hygienic and safe manner.
      * Cleaning agents, knives, razors and other harmful materials or substances must be stored safely and out of children’s reach in a separate locked cupboard or drawer.
      * Traditional stove top chip pans are extremely hazardous and must not be used. Electrical thermostatically controlled chip fryers are the safest, but still present dangers.
      * Kettles should be of the cordless variety.

### Gardens

      * All gardening equipment and tools must be locked away and inaccessible to children.
      * Subject to the carers categories of approval, pools and ponds etc must be behind fencing with secure gated entry or securely covered.
      * Gardens must be maintained in a reasonable condition which allows children to play safely.
      * Boundary fences should be secure.
      * The carer may only have a small garden which does not allow children to play, but this may be supplemented by a Public park nearby where children can go or be taken.
      * Any play equipment in the garden must be in a good state of repair and have the appropriate safety devices attached e.g. safety netting and flooring around trampolines.

### Computers

      * Computers with internet access should remain in common areas of the house. Children should not have access to computers in their own rooms where they are unsupervised.

*Further guidance can be obtained in the Internet Policy.*

### Under 8s

Higher safety standards are required for carers who are approved for
Under 8s:-

      * Child stair gates are required on the top and bottom of the stairs and across kitchen doors
      * Plastic covers are required on all electric sockets
      * Catches are required on drawers and cupboards
      * The temperature of radiators and hot water is reduced to prevent scalds and burns (usually below 43 degrees C)
      * All ponds and swimming pools are either covered or fenced off to prevent the children gaining access.
      * Added attention is given to other hazards e.g. table clothes and items which could be pulled on top of themselves by the child.
      * U8s should have restricted access to the kitchen, particularly during food preparation and cooking. For under 3’s in the kitchen they should be secure in a play pen or high chair where they can be kept safe.

### Children with disabilities

The accommodation of carers who are approved for children with
disabilities is fit for use and appropriate to their categories of
approval.

### Pets

The presence of animals in foster homes can be of real benefit and in
certain cases have a therapeutic effect on children. However, some pets
can be a risk as well. Carers and WF need to ensure that the children's
welfare is protected at all times. Therefore, the possible implications
caused by any pets will be assessed on its own merits.

It is impossible for this document to provide guidance on anything other
than the normal or standard type of pet a family is likely to have.
Where required specialist advice is to be sought.

Normally pets in the household will be considered at the time of the
Health and Safety inspection. However, there is an ongoing duty to
ensure children's safety and household circumstances can quickly change
e.g. looking after another person's pets or your own pet being unwell.
The ultimate responsibility is always on the Foster Carer to ensure that
their household (and other households they visit) remain safe. This is
not only a requirement at the time of the inspection, but an ongoing
duty.

#### In all cases

In all cases pets are expected to be well cared for and fully up to date
with their inoculations.

All pets are to be looked after in a hygienic way i.e. their food and
water is fresh and does not contaminate human food preparation, all
faeces, litter trays are cleaned regularly and do not present a risk to
humans. Some animal faeces can cause disease which leads to blindness.

Households should not have any offensive odours resulting from owning
pets and any animal hair, feathers etc should be regularly vacuumed up.

Cats and dogs need to have regular worming and flea treatments.

WF will not tolerate any circumstances of cruelty to animals and will
not assess any candidates who have been convicted of cruelty to animals.
Any existing Carers who receive such a conviction will need to undergo a
full review of their care.

If the Foster Carer finds or believes that the child/young person is
being cruel to the pet(s) in the household then the child/young person's
Social Worker will need to be informed as well as the Carer's
Supervising Social Worker. In most cases it is the temperament of the
animal which should be assessed. Are they protective of their owners,
are they aggressive all the time or only at certain times e.g.
protecting food or property.

Some animals are likely to enter children's rooms and sleep on their
beds. As well as the hygiene considerations there is a risk of
suffocation to small children particularly by cats and small dogs.
Strategies must be in place to prevent this. If an animal poses a risk
the Carer must have a strategy to either reduce or remove the risk. This
must always be considered when assessing the risk to children, but no
compromises can be made on their safety.

#### Dogs

WF has its own dog risk assessment which is to be completed on all dog
owning households. Each Dog is expected to have its own assessment.

WF will not permit Foster Carers to either be assessed or remain on its
register if they have a Dangerous Dog as classified under the Dangerous
Dogs Act 1991. These are:-

      * the Pit Bull Terrier
      * the Japanese tosa
      * the Dogo Argentino
      * the Fila Brasileiro

However, many placing authorities will not be willing to place children
with Carers who have animals which are perceived to be a risk e.g. pits
bull terriers, including Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Bull Terriers,
Dobermans, Rottweilers, BullmastiWF and Rhodesian Ridgebacks.

#### Cats

Cats can present risks similar to dogs in terms of behaviour and
temperaments. The level of potential contact with children needs to be
assessed.

All floors and furniture should be regularly vacuumed so that cat hairs
do not become a source of allergies to children.

#### Fish

In most cases the fish themselves do not present a risk to children. The
risks are through either the presence of water e.g. ponds or a tank
tipping over electrical appliances or the risk of harm from a toppling
tank or the glass structure of the tank.

A common sense approach must be taken when assessing these types of
risks and measures put in place to protect children e.g. ponds must be
covered for Carers who care for the under 8s.

#### Small or caged animals

These may be rabbits, gerbils, mice, rats or hamsters etc. The pet's
cage must be clean and safe from obvious hazards both to humans and the
pets. The temperament of the animal needs consideration due to potential
risks from biting. It is not recommend that children handle these
animals without adult supervision.

It is not recommended that hamsters and other nocturnal animals are
bought as pets as they are awake at night when the children are asleep
and then sleep during the day.

Reptiles can hold certain diseases on their skins. Specialist advice
will need to be sought. However, it is recommended that they are kept
securely in their vivarium tanks and children do not have access to
them.

## Children & the Internet

Access to the internet can be gained by a number of means and places
e.g. at school, via mobile phones, home computers, handheld devices,
clubs etc. Computers are a part of modern life and it is vital that
young people have access to them and learn how to use them
appropriately. They can be a great tool for helping with research or
homework, in looking for jobs and colleges. However the internet does
contain a number of risks, some of which are listed below.

      * Pornographic material – it is widely known that security systems are minimal to gain access to explicit adult material and there are many web sites containing illegal images.
      * 
      * Chat rooms – These are forums where people can chat on line using text type messages. It is widely known, through the press and media, that many people lie about their age and identity in chat rooms and some adults who wish to harm young people use chat rooms as a way of gaining access to children and abductions.
      * 
      * Illegal downloads and file sharing – lots of people download music and films and share these on line or by using mobile phones. However, this can result in a £2,000 fine through copyright laws.
      * 
      * Financial manipulation – there are sites set up explicitly to extort money out of people, where ‘money’ can be spent and added to mobile phone bills (even from normal computers) and recently there have been an explosion of poker websites. There are many other sites like these designed to extract money.
      * 
      * Bullying – children have been bullied through threatening emails and texts messages (see Bullying P & P).
      * 
      * Happy slapping – highlighted in the media, some people assault others and film it on their phones to share with others. Your child could either be a perpetrator or victim of this. The matter is treated as assault by the police and if found guilty perpetrators are liable for convictions.
      * 
      * Personal information – sites such as Facebook allow a great deal of personal information to be published both by the young people themselves and by carers and their households. This can lead to risks and vulnerability e.g. family member being able to communicate with young people who have no contact orders. Carers need to be aware of what information and pictures are being displayed.

### How to reduce risks

Clearly the best way to reduce a risk is to remove it altogether.
However, this is not practical in the modern world. Our best
recommendation is that when young people are using the internet or
computers they should be supervised. Household computers should be
situated in open places where their use can be monitored. We strongly
advise against allowing any child to have a computer with internet
access in their bedrooms.

Most internet Service Providers (ISPs) have free tools or programmes to
block inappropriate web sites. However, these are not 'fail safe' and
young people can learn to disable these or work around them. If the
young people you look after have access to the Net, you should be
warning them about the risks and especially about not giving away
personal information or details. It would be good to get them to avoid
chat rooms all together. WF have been able to facilitate a CEOP
presentation for young people placed in your carer and for your birth
children. We strongly advice that you encourage the young people to take
part in this presentation when it becomes available.

You should also advise children and young people not to open email
unless they know the person who has sent them. There are a great deal of
unsolicited e mails out there that contain viruses which can destroy
your computer or 'Trojan horses' which send your personal details out to
people for fraudulent use.

It is also good practice to limit the time that a young person spends on
the computer. Prolonged periods in front of a PC can cause eye damage
and does not help promote a child's social skills or health.

If you have any concerns over the way the young person accesses the Net
or uses it you should seek advice and guidance from your SSW
immediately. Guidance can also be obtained from the CEOP website listed
below.

Issues linked to the internet can quickly and easily escalate and
warrant consideration of using the child protection procedure. If
concerned that a young person may be at risk of harm, access to the Net
must be stopped immediately and consult with your SSW.

If the concerns arise from use of a computer elsewhere such as a school
you must share your concerns with a representative of that organisation
e.g. a teacher.

## Transporting children

All Staff, Foster Carers and their supporters must transport children in
the safest possible manner and must not take avoidable risks. A common
sense approach must be taken when transporting children.

### Responsibilities

Whoever is actually transporting the child is immediately responsible
for their welfare. However, if the Foster Carer allows another person to
transport a child, e.g. a supporter or family member, they must ensure
that they understand the risks and the chosen method of transport meets
this policy. They cannot delegate their duties.

If there is any uncertainty the trip must be delayed to allow for
guidance to be sought from either your SSW or in respect of staff their
Line Manager.

Where a journey is considered too high a risk e.g. through the child's
behaviour, the journey must not be undertaken unless safe alternative
arrangements are made e.g. two adults escorting the child with one sat
next to them in the back and the cars child locks engaged.

WF accepts no liability or responsibility for any fixed penalties, fines
or endorsements received when transporting children. These remain the
responsibility of the driver.

### Vehicles used for transporting Children

All vehicles used for transporting Looked After Children must:

      * Have a current valid MOT certificate and be road legal (MOT only verifies a vehicle’s condition on a particular day).
      * Have valid road tax.
      * Have rear seat belts that are operational
      * Never carry more passengers in a vehicle than the manufacturer’s recommendation.
      * Must have its safety systems operational e.g. air bags etc.
      * Any driver of a vehicle transporting Look After Children must:
      * Have a valid and current full UK driving license
      * Have fully comprehensive insurance and their insurers are informed that the vehicle is to be used to transport foster children.
      * Be in a fit state to drive the vehicle
      * Be driven legally and according to the Highway Code
      * Remember that they act as role models to children i.e. being careful of road rage or not to promote irresponsible driving.
      * Not use mobile phones in vehicles without hands free kits.
      * Use additional safety devices e.g. baby or booster seats where required

### Children in front seats, baby seats and seat belt use

The law regulating the use of child seats changed in October 2006:-

The law requires all children travelling in cars to use an **appropriate
child restraint** or adult seat belt, with very few exceptions which are
listed below.

It is the driver\'s responsibility to ensure that children under the age
of 14 years are restrained correctly in accordance with the law.

In the Front Seat The child MUST use the correct child restraint. It is
illegal to carry a child in a rear-facing child seat in the front, which
is protected by an active frontal airbag.

In the Rear Seat The child MUST use the correct child restraint.

In a licensed taxi or licensed hire car, if a child restraint is not
available then the child may travel unrestrained in the rear. This is
the only exception for children under 3, and has been introduced for
practical rather than safety reasons. You should always think about ways
to make sure that a child seat is available.

**It is the driver\'s legal responsibility to ensure that the child is
correctly restrained. Children aged 3 and above, until they reach EITHER
their 12th birthday OR 135cm in height** In the Front Seat The child
MUST use the correct child restraint.

In the Rear Seat The child MUST use the correct restraint, where seat
belts are fitted. There are three exceptions where there is not a child
seat available. In each case the child MUST use the adult belt instead.

They are -

      - in a licensed taxi or private hire vehicle;
      - if the child is travelling on a short distance for reason of unexpected necessity;
      - if there are two occupied child restraints in the rear which prevent the fitment of a third.

In addition, a child 3 and over may travel unrestrained in the rear seat
of a vehicle if seat belts are not available.

It is the driver\'s legal responsibility to ensure that the child is
correctly restrained.

Children over 1.35 metres in height, or who are 12 or 13 years old

In the Front Seat The adult seat belt MUST be worn if available.

In the Rear Seat The adult seat belt MUST be worn if available.

**It is the driver\'s legal responsibility to ensure that the child is
correctly restrained.**

### Passengers Over 14 years

When travelling in the front or rear seat, an adult seat belt MUST be
worn if available.

It is the responsibility of the individual passenger to ensure that they
are wearing the seat belt.

### More Passengers than Seat Belts

If there are not enough seat belts or child restraints in the car for
all the passengers, then some may legally travel in the rear of the
vehicle without wearing a seat belt. This may be legal, but it is not
safe. Between 8 and 15 front seat occupants are killed every year by
unbelted rear seat passengers flying forward in an accident.

WF policy is to only carry the same number of passengers as there are
seat belts. Anything else is unsafe and puts lives at risk. If
necessary, use two cars or make two journeys for the trip. The following
is taken from the Dept of Transport:-

When fitting a child car seat in your car, always follow the
manufacturer\'s instructions thoroughly and allow plenty of time. The
same applies when it comes to strapping a baby or child into the seat.
Make sure your child car seat is properly fitted every time you use it.
Always keep a copy of the fitting instructions in your car.

Child seats are designed for various weights and sizes of children. It
is important that you check with the manufacturers guidelines or a
professional fitter to ensure that you are using the correct seat for
the child(ren).

Always make sure that your children\'s car seat belts are properly
adjusted and fastened before setting off in the car, even on the
shortest of trips. Remember to set a good example by fastening your own
belt.

Never place a rear-facing seat near an active frontal airbag.
Forward-facing restraints should be as far back from the airbag as
possible. Always check the car handbook.

Never modify a child car seat or seat belt to try to make it fit.

Lap and diagonal belts are safer than lap-only belts.

### Monitoring

During Health and safety inspections Carers will be required to produce
their vehicle documentation:-

      * Full UK driving license of the primary Carers
      * Fully comprehensive insurance for each car to be used
      * Current MOT certificate(s)
      * General inspection of the condition of the vehicle

### Public Transport

Key life skills can be taught to young people through using public
transport and there are many benefits to this mode of transport.
However, there are increased risks e.g. managing difficult behaviours in
public places, the public's reaction to this, the dangers of trains and
railway lines.

The best approach is to undertake a quick mental risk assessment,
considering the likely risks and the consequence of those risks. If
there is a risk of harm, the journey should not be undertaken or
appropriate measures put in place to reduce the risk to an acceptable
level.

Again Carers/staff are role models to the children we look after, public
transport must be treated with respect and all fares paid accordingly.

### Taxis

Children must always be escorted in taxis unless the taxi company
concerned is an approved company and its drivers enhanced CRB checks. WF
and placing authority must approve any taxi journeys for children where
they are expected to travel unescorted. Unless previously agreed WF will
not be responsible for the costs of using taxis.

### Notifications

All those who are likely to transport children on a regular basis are
required to notify WF of any motoring offences which they have either
been charged with or convicted of including speeding fines.

Failure to notify WF of the above could place a Carer at risk of their
approval to foster being terminated. Similarly, staff members risk a
disciplinary investigation.

### Dangerous Activities

It would be impossible to remove all risks from life, however certain
activities carry a higher than normal risk of harm and it is important
that these are recognised and appropriate measures put in place to
either remove or minimise the risks of harm to a person. The welfare of
the individual undertaking the activity is a priority.

Carers must exercise their duties in protecting and promoting the
welfare of the children they look after using the same consideration as
a reasonable parent might towards their own children. However,
remembering that these are not their own children and they do not hold
parental responsibility over the children they look after. This places
restrictions and limitations on the decisions carers can make

In some cases the child's social worker may need to give approval for a
child to participate in certain activities e.g. rugby, skiing, sailing.
If you are in any doubt as to what constitutes a dangerous activity or
whether you are allowed to undertake a certain activity with a child you
should contact the child's Social Worker for advice. Carers can also
contact their SSW for guidance and if necessary a risk assessment will
be conducted.

### Risk Assessments

The aim of risk assessments is to look at the activity, assess the
likelihood that an accident will happen and what the consequence of that
accident may be. If there is an assessed risk the next step will be to
put in place suitable control measures to either remove or minimise the
potential harm. E.g. a high risk activity would be one where there is a
high chance of harm coupled with a serious injury like rock climbing
without safety equipment, the harm could easily be death. The control
measures would be to have a qualified person running the activity,
ensuring the young people participating are actually able to undertake
the activity, the use of safety hats, safety ropes and people holding
the ropes. The assessment would conclude that the activity must not be
undertaken without these control measures.

Normally a risk assessment should be undertaken prior to starting the
activity, depending on the activity provider and how the activity has
been arranged a pre-written risk assessment can usually be obtained.
These are called generic risk assessments and can be obtained in advance
from the activity organiser.

If there is no risk assessment for the activity you wish to undertake
you should consult with your SSW to discuss the best way forward. In
such cases an activity specific risk assessment must be conducted.

WF has a risk assessment format which can be used to help identify and
establish the level of risk. If this is required you should contact your
SSW.
