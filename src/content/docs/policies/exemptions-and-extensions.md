title: Exemptions and Extensions
---


## - Usual Fostering Limit on Number of Children

A person may not foster more than three children in each foster home
except where all children are siblings.

A child may be placed with foster carers for up to 6 days without
affecting this limit.

In all other circumstances, foster carers may only exceed this number if
an exemption has been agreed.

## - Reasons why an Exemption may be considered

Applications will usually be made because of the following exceptional
circumstances:

      * a. The child concerned was previously placed with the foster carers and his or her placement elsewhere has disrupted
      * b. The foster carers have special skills to meet the child's needs which are not available elsewhere
      * c. The placement of the child over the limit is the most appropriate way of meeting the child's needs arising from disability, race, religion, language and/or culture
      * d. The placement is required to keep siblings together

Applications can only be made with the agreement of the foster carers
concerned.

When considering an exemption the following factors should be regarded

      * a. The number, ages and circumstances of the children concerned
      * b. The arrangements proposed for the care and accommodation of the children concerned
      * c. The relationship between the foster carers and the children concerned
      * d. The period of time over which the placement is likely to last
      * e. The likely effect on the children concerned and any other children living in the household
      * f. The foster carers' capacity to provide sufficient care for all the children in the placement.
      * g. The need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the fostered children / young people and any other children / young people who live in the foster home.

## - The Process for Exemptions

### - Planned Exemptions

The need for an exemption will be identified at the point when the
fostering service is seeking to identify a suitable placement for a
child or children, i.e. where a foster carer is identified as the most
appropriate option to meet the child\'s needs, and this is agreed by the
Supervising Social Worker for the carers and the foster carer.

The social worker(s) to any other child in the placement should be
consulted in order to seek their views on any impact (positive or
negative) from an exemption being granted.

All applications for plan for approval. The written application will be
prepared by the Supervising Social Worker or the Agency Manager in
conjunction with the relevant child\'s social worker.

The decision whether or not to grant an exemption will be recorded in
writing, together with reasons. Any exemption will be specific to a
child or children and can be subject to conditions. The foster carer
will be notified in writing of the decision.

Upon the granting of an exemption, a time limit will be specified and an
exemption can only extend beyond that date if the authorised.

The decision must be recorded.

The decision will be reported to the next available Fostering Panel for
ratification.

### - Emergency Exemptions

A child can only be placed in a foster home above the usual limit for up
to 6 days without specific authority to exempt the foster home from the
limit.

An application for exemption must be made to the Chair of the Fostering
Panel or the Vice Chair as soon as practicable thereafter and any such
exemption needs to be presented to the next available Fostering Panel,
as with planned exemptions.

An interim decision may be necessary on an emergency basis pending full
consideration of the exemption.

Any emergency decisions to grant an exemption must be confirmed in
writing and copies of the decision, together with the reasons, must be
placed on the child\'s file and the foster carer\'s case record. A copy
must also be sent to the foster carer.

The decision must be recorded.

## - Review and Monitoring of Exemptions

The Fostering Panel will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring of
the exemption.

The Fostering Service is responsible for recording the ending the
exemption when the exemption is no longer required.

## - Extension to Foster Carer Approval

Where a foster placement is identified for a child and would be within
the usual fostering limit but outside of the foster carer\'s terms of
approval, an extension to their approval is required.

The same principles and processes apply to extensions as set out above
for exemptions and all extensions must be reported to the Fostering
Panel.
