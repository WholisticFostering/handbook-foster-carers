title: 🔄 Exemptions & Extensions
---


## 📘 Purpose

This policy explains when and how foster carers may be allowed to care
for more children than usual (exemptions), or take children outside
their standard approval (extensions). All decisions prioritise child
welfare and are in line with fostering regulations.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Usual Fostering Limit

By law, carers must not foster more than **three children** in one
home---unless all are **siblings**.

Children placed for **up to 6 days** do not count toward this limit. To
exceed the limit longer term, an **exemption** is required.

## ✅ When an Exemption May Be Needed

An exemption may be considered where:

-   A child previously placed has had a placement breakdown
-   Carers have specialist skills that meet the child's unique needs
-   It\'s important to keep **siblings together**
-   A cultural/religious/language match is best met with these carers

The carers **must agree** to the exemption request.

Key considerations:

-   Number, ages, and needs of all children in the home
-   Impact on existing placements
-   Duration of the proposed exemption
-   Ability of the carers to meet all children\'s needs
-   Overall safety and welfare of all children in the household

## 📝 Planned Exemptions: The Process

1\. Identified when matching a child with carers. 2. SSW and carer agree
in principle. 3. Social workers for **other children in placement** are
consulted. 4. A written application is made by the SSW or Agency
Manager, with input from the child's social worker. 5. A **written
decision** is made, recorded, and shared with carers. 6. Time limits may
be set, with conditions. 7. The exemption is reported to the **next
Fostering Panel** for ratification.

## 🚨 Emergency Exemptions

For short-term emergencies, a placement over the usual limit can last up
to **6 days** without prior exemption.

Steps:

-   Apply to Panel Chair/Vice-Chair ASAP
-   Provide a written decision and reasoning
-   Place decision on:
    -   Child's file
    -   Carer's file
    -   Send copy to foster carers
-   Present at next Panel meeting

## 📆 Monitoring & Review

-   All exemptions are monitored by the **Fostering Panel**
-   The Agency is responsible for formally **ending** exemptions when no
    longer needed

## ➕ Extensions to Approval Terms

If a child's placement fits within the usual limit but outside of the
carer's current **approval terms**, an **extension** is required.

Extensions follow the same steps as exemptions and are also reported to
the Fostering Panel.
