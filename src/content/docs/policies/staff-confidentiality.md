title: Staff Confidentiality
---


The content of supervision generally remains confidential between the
supervisor and supervisee; however, there may be circumstances in which
they need to be shared with another relevant professional. Supervision
records are the property of the organisation, not the individual.

Where supervision notes refer to other staff and/or service, staff
should treat this as confidential in relation to the requirements of the
Data Protection Act 1998. Where possible the use of initials will help
to safeguard this information.

## Access to Supervision Records

Access to supervision records should be controlled and all records
should be locked away so that others who do not have a legitimate right
to see the records cannot access them. Supervisees should be aware,
however, that in addition to themselves and their supervisors, others
will, from time to time, access records for quality assurance purposes,
and these might include:

      * The Directors who may quality assure a random selection of case files and supervision notes
      * External Inspectors, e.g. Ofsted;
      * Investigating Officers for disciplinary purposes. 

Supervisees should be asked for their consent to share information
relating to their supervision records (before it is shared) for any
purpose, unless with good reason this has not been possible. Where
consent is not forthcoming and information must be shared, the reasons
for this must be explained to the supervisee.

The Supervision Agreement and the Supervision Records will be kept on
the supervisee\'s file held by the supervisor or in an agreed, secure
place. It is a matter for the supervisor what other documents are held
with the supervision records, these may include appraisal, case
management records, personnel records as appropriate, or any other
information by agreement with the supervisor and the supervisee.

When a supervisee leaves, the records should be retained for at least
six years and then shredded.

## Information Sharing

It is important that informed consent is gained from children and young
people and foster carers and they are kept informed about how personal
information is being shared. There are situations in which information
should be shared even if consent has not been given in order to protect
the welfare of a young person; prevent offending or when at risk of
harm.

## Equality and Diversity

All employees must be respectful and anti-oppressive in the ways in
which they discuss Looked After Children, their foster carers, other
agencies and colleagues and be conscious of their own power in the
supervision process of foster carers. Antidiscriminatory supervision
begins by ensuring that all elements and aspects of supervision are
carefully and professionally undertaken.
