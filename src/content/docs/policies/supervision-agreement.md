title: Supervision Agreement
---


The process of developing a Supervision Agreement is as important as the
written document itself. This process should begin at the first
supervision session though it may not be completed in one session.

The purpose of the Supervision Agreement is to establish a basis for
which the supervisor and supervisee will work together during one to one
supervision meetings. This establishment of \'ground rules\' clarifies
the rights and expectations on both sides to create a safe, secure and
effective supervisory setting.

When establishing the supervision agreement with new employees the
following should be discussed:

      * The role of supervision in promoting anti-discriminatory practice and make explicit that discriminatory attitudes and behaviour will be challenged;
      * The purpose of supervision;
      * The frequency of supervision;
      * Takes place in a dedicated, protected place; where others cannot overhear;
      * Any specific responsibilities of both supervisor and supervisee;
      * The recording of supervision, including where records will be (confidentially) held. Whether records will be typed or handwritten, how quickly records will be given to the supervisee for signature;
      * The arrangements for an ad-hoc or unplanned supervision;
      * The complaints and review process;
      * The practical arrangements;
      * The format to be used.
