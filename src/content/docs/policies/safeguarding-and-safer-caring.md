title: Safeguarding & Safer Caring
---


Please use the following Guidelines, to assist you, when completing a
'Safe Caring Family Policy'. It is designed to be of help to both Foster
Carers and Supervising Social Workers.

National Standards require that each Fostering Family produce a Safe
Caring Family Policy:

Standard 9.3 of the National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services
requires safe caring guidelines to be provided, based on a written
policy, for each foster home, in consultation with the carer and
everyone else in the household. These guidelines must be cleared with
each child's social worker and be explained clearly and appropriately to
the child.

request that each family produce a Safe Caring Family Policy to help
reinforce an understanding of what safe caring means and to help achieve
high standards of safe care.\</font\>

## Who Should Complete a Safe Caring Family Policy?

If the assessment has been undertaken by a permanent Wholistic\<font
12.8000001907349px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>Fostering\</font\>
Supervising Social Worker then the Safe Caring Family Policy should be
completed during the assessment process, by the Supervising Social
Worker in collaboration with the Fostering Applicants.

If the assessment has been undertaken by a Freelance Worker then there
are two options:

1\. The Supervising Social Worker who is maintaining contact and likely
to assume the link role should complete the Safe Caring Family Policy in
collaboration with the Fostering Applicants, prior to, or just after
Panel.

2\. If the Applicant is allocated to a Supervising Social Worker for
assessment, the respective Supervising Social Worker should complete the
Safe Caring Family Policy in collaboration with the Applicants through
the assessment process.

For existing Foster Carers current Supervising Social Workers should
complete the Safe Caring Family Policy in collaboration with the Foster
Carers they link with, as part of their next visit.

## When Should a Safe Caring Family Policy be Completed?

All Safe Caring Family Policies should be completed prior to the
placement of a child. A template is provided for the Safe Caring Family
Policy, this is a general template that can be modified to individual
circumstances. A Safe Caring Family Policy should be reviewed with each
new placement, where a placement is stable/long term it will be reviewed
as part of the Annual Foster Carer's Review process.

Safe Caring Family Policies will need to be revised as the circumstances
of the household change, (new household member, change of main carer,
moving houses etc). Or if there is a variation in the respective foster
carer's approval. This should be done immediately. In such cases the
revised guidelines will need to be cleared with the social worker of any
child in placement.

1\. Introduction Working out a Safer Care Family policy for your family
including your foster child is not about changing everything that you
do. It is about thinking about what parts of the family's behaviour
involve risk and working out what you can all do so that safer care
becomes part of everyday life. This will have already been covered on
the Skills To Foster course/preparation training.

It will also help you to know how to deal with situations that might
seem OK in your own family but are not safe in a foster family. It is
important that everybody that is in the house is aware of the policy and
is signed up to it. Regular visitors to the home need to know about the
Safer Care Family Policy.

The whole family should be involved in agreeing your policy and in
reviewing it each year (or when circumstances change). Your Supervising
Social Worker can support you with this. When you have completed your
Safer Care Family policy you should discuss it with the child's social
worker and give a copy to Brent Fostering Service. Sometimes you may
need to review your Safer Care Family policy because something new
happens like a new placement.

The aim is for all those involved to understand what might happen and to
avoid the child feeling worried or anxious.

When you go on holiday you will need to think about your Safer Care
Family policy.

The objectives of safer caring practices are:

-   To keep the foster child safe from abuse by adults
-   To keep children in the foster home safe from abuse by other
    children in the household
-   To keep members of the foster family safe from false allegations of
    abuse

All those involved in foster care, need to acknowledge that although
small in number, children in foster care can and have been abused by
adults entrusted to care for them, or birth children of foster carers or
visitors to their home. Foster children and young people may abuse their
siblings or other children; or may make false allegations against you or
other members of your household.

Allegations are an occupational hazard of fostering and by trying to
avoid them we might become organised by and act in fear, which will not
enhance the desired physical and emotional responses we need when caring
for children. What is needed is that foster carers and people working
with children always try to act with integrity and can speak about our
thinking behind our actions so we are then in a position to manage
allegations without adopting a defensive stance.

An important starting point when considering safer care is for you to
understand your values, and how you operate as a family or household.

When caring for a child with a disability extra consideration needs to
be given to and specific needs and personal care that will need to put
in place that may differ from the norms of the family and a record of
the reasoning behind these changes.

You will also require adequate resources, training and support. Brent
Placements Service accepts its responsibility in providing these
essential tools and is committed to working closely with you in
developing and maintaining safer practices. There is core and specialist
training workshops for you to attend, with regular supervision given to
all Brent Foster Carers, as well as more specialist support provided,
when required.

## Developing a Safer Care Family Policy

### 1.1 Guidance

Safer Caring will form part of the core subjects for approved foster
carers training. You will be expected to have attended training on Safer
Care within the first two years of your approval.

You should be clear and direct in telling children about their rights to
personal space, boundaries and limits, and in teaching them how to go
about claiming those rights for themselves. Children learn what they
live and part of their learning comes from their role models.You are
encouraged to get into the routine of seeking help and support from
Placements workers, the child's social worker and other foster carers,
it is less likely that you may end up in crisis.

Practical help in the home, regular time off - for an evening, a day,
can leave you with more energy for the time you spend with the child and
your own family. It is important to develop a range of support systems
inside and outside of their foster home.

It is essential you read and discuss this Policy with the Assessing
Social Worker or the Supervising Social Worker prior to completing the
form (see form).

We recognise that caring for vulnerable children and young people can be
very rewarding and also very challenging. We want to ensure that we have
explored with you, how you and your family will manage caring for
children in ways which will lessen the risks of harmful or potentially
harmful situations, occurring and/or minimise complaints or allegations
being made.

By completing this policy with your Supervising Social Worker, you will
help to ensure that members of your household are kept safer from
allegations and concerns. This Safer Care Family Policy is one way we
hope to highlight the importance of safe care in your household.

Another way is for you to attend the Safer Caring course and/or other
relevant training.

Although it is important to note that prescriptive formulas for safe
caring are not always possible and that the discussion about possible
dilemmas that might be encountered is as important as completing the
Safer Care Family policy form. Ensure you and your family have the time
to discuss and explore the implications of the decisions you are making
about ways of providing safer caring.

Information should be sought from the child's social worker at the time
of placement about any specific needs or issues relating to the child
which will need to be taken into account. This should include any care
needs relating to the health or any disabilities a child may have.

People have different ways of showing affection. You need to be careful
not to impose your ways on others. In addition, if touch has meant
something other than affection to a child in the past, they might not
understand that when you try to show them physical affection this is not
intended as a prelude to sexual activity. A safe rule to follow is that
no-one touches another person's body without that person's permission.
Children should always be asked if they would like a kiss or a hug or a
cuddle. They need to be taught by a caring adult to say 'no' if they
don't want to be touched. You might need to help an older foster child
work out how to seek comfort from an adult in appropriate ways.

It is important to note that showing affection and warmth to a foster
child or young person is an essential part of your role, that it is not
safe to not be affectionate, but that affection should always be
negotiated and can be expressed verbally even if physical demonstrations
are not ok for the foster child.

## 2. Working out your Safer Caring Policy

### 2.1 The Names you use

Children should call you by your first name.

Discourage the child from calling you \'mummy\' or \'daddy\' because it
causes confusion about their own family.

### 2.2 How and where do you dress/ undress in your family and what do you wear at home?

It is important to think about how people dress around the home. Don't
walk around in your underwear or nightwear. If you do, you could trigger
something in a child's memory and cause them to respond inappropriately.
Their misinterpretations might leave family members feeling confused and
uncomfortable and not knowing what to do about it. Make sure that your
family and children joining your household have a dressing gown and
slippers as well as nightwear.

### 2.3 The bathroom

All children who are old enough and able to bath and wash themselves
should have privacy in the bathroom. If a child needs adult help and
supervision, where possible, it is preferable for a female carer - or
older female child - to bath, dry and dress them. The door should be
kept unlocked and slightly open.

### 2.4 Playing

Try and keep all children within earshot when they are playing and have
a quick check when they go quiet. Children who have been sexually abused
should be supervised closely. Think about what you can do to make sure
everyone is kept safe. You may decide that the child and others should
play at your home. These decisions about safety and privacy are more
difficult when they are about older children - discuss with your
Supervising Social Worker or the child's social worker if you are not
sure.

### 2.5 Stopping Bullying

-   Put in place clear rules that say bullying is not acceptable and
    what actions will be taken if you suspect bullying or are told of
    bullying happening.
-   Make it clear to children what are acceptable behaviours.
-   Provide opportunities for children to think about the issue of
    bullying e.g. writing stories or poems or drawing pictures about
    bullying.
-   Have discussions about bullying and why it matters.
-   Be good role models.

### 2.6 Travelling by car

It is important that you are aware of the safety requirements, regarding
travelling with children in the car. All children under the age of 10
years (and below a certain height) are required to use car seats and
seat belts, appropriate to their age. According to the experience of the
child, other safety issues may need to be taken into account regarding
transporting children to and from activities.

### 2.7 Foster Carers bedrooms

You may have allowed your own children into your bed in the mornings or
to be comforted when they were not well. You need to be aware of the
dangers of doing this when you are fostering a child. It will be safer
to provide all children with a time of warmth and affection outside of
your bedroom, it is important you explain this to your own children,
prior to foster children being placed, so it does not create friction or
a dilemma for the family later on.

You should ensure the bedroom door is closed if you and your partner are
having an intimate relationship and children should be encouraged to
knock on your door before entering.

### 2.8 Children\'s bedroom

Children need their privacy respected.They need their own space so that
they can learn that they have the right to be safe and private. For some
children it is important that they have somewhere to keep their
possessions safe. Your family policy should be clear about bedroom
rules; people must understand how threatening it can be for a child who
has been abused to have their privacy invaded. As children grow older
they should be given increasing control over who goes into their room.
Anyone who needs to go into a child's bedroom should ask permission
first and should leave the door open. This applies to children as well
as adults. Men in particular need to be aware and sensitive about what
they do.

### 2.9 Bedtimes

Consideration needs to be given to age appropriate bedtimes. Similar
precautions should be given to bedtime routines as those given to bath
times, and for the same reasons. All carers should leave the door open
when putting children to bed. Everyone must think about doing things in
a way that is safe for children.

### 2.10 Taking photos, videos and the internet

It should be clear in the Placement Plan who can sign to agree for the
child's photo or video footage being taken in settings such as school.

If photos, videos or the internet have been part of any abuse for the
child/young person, you should check the best way forward with the
child's social worker.

It is always helpful when you do take photos or videos, ask the child\'s
permission first and make sure that they get copies for and that they
know who else will see them and why. Photos are an important record of a
child's past so where appropriate record information for them to take
with them in their own photo album or life story book. Foster children's
photos cannot be published without Brent's permission.

When the child uses the internet, take an interest in what they do and
agree, when, where and how they will use it. Look into some software
that filters inappropriate material for children.

### 2.11 Sex and Sexuality

Relationships and sex education is important for all of us as we grow
up. This should also be age appropriate. Children need to be helped to
think about what makes a good friend and what makes a bad friend. They
need to learn how to avoid situations that might put them at risk of
abuse and how to protect themselves and others. Children need to learn
how to say 'no'. You need to know how to explain the difference between
what is and is not acceptable behaviour and how to help children change
behaviour that is not right for their age. You may need to say that you
are talking to them about relationships and sex to help them deal with
situations, feel safer and as part of growing up not to abuse them
further.

Families will have different approaches to this subject and how children
get information about relationships, sex and sexuality and what they are
told. You will need to find out from the child's social worker what the
family's approach was and the best way of dealing with this,
particularly if the child/young person has a different cultural or
religious background from your own. You may also want to check out with
school what they are doing on the subject so you can be prepared.

Providing a safer environment means that other children in the foster
home must understand that any sexual activity with a foster child is as
unacceptable as with a biological brother or sister. See Relationships
and Sex.

The most important thing is that the child feels they can come and ask
you questions and talk to you about the subject if they are not sure.
Foster carers should never share personal details about this subject
with the child.

When a child or young person is placed or being placed with you, where
it is known they are vulnerable due to earlier abuse and resulting
behaviours, or they are known to have abused other children, self harm,
regularly abscond or have other higher level concerns or behaviour, the
child's social worker, in conjunction with you should complete a
separate child risk assessment looking at their specific needs in and
outside of the foster home. See the Safer Care Family Policy form.
Information from this assessment can then be used to inform the
completion of the Safer Care Family Policy.

A health and safety checklist will be completed by the assessing social
worker for the foster family and will be reviewed and updated whenever
there is another child placed, change of placements, building works,
etc. Any areas of concern should be indicated and action taken to remedy
these concerns.

As part of the Foster Carer Agreement, carers will sign an undertaking
not to administer corporal punishment to children and young people in
their care. Guidance is given as part of the Foster Carers' Handbook
regarding the definition of corporal punishment and alternative
management behaviour strategies carers can use when disciplining
children and setting appropriate boundaries.

You will be provided with a foster carer's diary on an annual basis and
children's log book for each child in placement. Apart from recording
important meetings in relation to the child or young person, foster
carers will also be expected to record significant incidents or events
that occur within the placement and this might involve issues of a safer
caring nature. These must be used in accordance with the Data Protection
Act (1998).

What information will/do you give to them about you being Foster Carers?
Who are regular visitors and would it be appropriate for them to sign
the family and friends document? (see attached safer caring policy form)

There is space in the form to include any other comments, observations
or family rules you would like recorded. You are advised to use this
space to record additional family rules which might have been missed
above. Remember the family safer caring policy document is to be kept in
a prominent place in your home and should be up dated and discussed with
all members of your house hold and every child or young person you care
for.

## 3. When you go out

You have responsibilities towards the children you are looking after and
towards those you ask to baby-sit or look after children. You need to
think what you can do to avoid putting everyone at risk.

You should be clear about what your Supervising Social Worker considers
are satisfactory arrangements for caring for children when you are out.
You could make an arrangement with other foster carers.

## 4. Children with Disabilities

Children with a disability may be particularly vulnerable to abuse.

There may be more of a need for intimate personal care. Where a
child/young person has a disability or complex health needs, you should
speak to the child's social worker for advice.

You should make sure that a child/young people with communication
difficulties has the opportunity to express their wishes about personal
care, and this should also be recorded.

## 5. Fire Plan

Discuss as a family what routes you will take if a fire starts and
practice an evacuation. Think about where keys are kept so everybody
knows where they will be for the front and back doors and windows.

## 6. Reviewing the Safer Care Family policy

All foster families must have a policy in place when we take you to the
Fostering Panel for approval. This policy should then be discussed and
reviewed with you whenever a new child or young person is placed, to
ensure that any specific needs or issues are taken into account
regarding their personal experiences and the way you will be taking care
of them. The Policy will also be checked and reviewed as continuing to
be relevant for you and your family at each subsequent Foster Carers
Annual Review.

You will need to read the first part of this policy and then complete
the form. You will then agree your actions initially with your assessing
social worker and once you are approved with your Supervising Social
Worker. A Fostering Manager will then sign it off the document

The Safer Care Family Policy should be updated in relation to changes in
the household and whenever a new child is placed to ensure it addresses
the specific needs of all the children and young people living in the
foster home, including the foster carers own birth children where
appropriate.

Where no significant changes have occurred in the foster home and/or no
changes of children living with the home (for example in Kinship or long
term foster placements), the Policy should be reviewed and updated on an
annual basis and signed off as part of the Annual Foster Carers Review.
This is to ensure the policy remains relevant and takes account of
evolving personalities and child development.
