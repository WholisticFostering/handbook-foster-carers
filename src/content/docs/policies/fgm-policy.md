lastUpdated: 2025-07-14

## 🎯 Purpose

This policy explains what FGM is, how to recognise it, and what carers
and staff must do if they are concerned that a child is at risk or has
experienced FGM. It complies with the FGM Act 2003 (as amended by the
Serious Crime Act 2015).

## ❗ What is FGM?

Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) involves the removal or injury of a
girl's genitalia for non-medical reasons. It is illegal, harmful, and a
form of child abuse.

## 👩‍⚕️ Who Must Report It?

If you\'re a regulated health or social care professional, or a teacher,
and you:

-   Are told directly by a girl under 18 that she has had FGM, **or**
-   See clear signs that FGM has taken place

...you **must** report it to the police under the mandatory reporting
duty.

## 📅 When to Report

Reports should be made as soon as possible, ideally by the **end of the
next working day**. You should act with the same urgency as any other
safeguarding concern.

## ☎️ How to Report

Call the police on **101** (non-emergency number). Be ready to provide:

-   Your name, role, work contact details
-   Your designated safeguarding lead's details
-   The girl\'s full name, date of birth, and address
-   Whether any safeguarding steps have already been taken

Ask for and keep a **reference number**.

## 📝 Record Keeping

Keep clear, detailed records, including:

-   What the girl disclosed or what you observed
-   Any safeguarding steps taken
-   Date and time of the police report and the reference number
-   Inform your supervising social worker and the agency safeguarding
    lead

## 👪 Informing the Child and Family

Social workers should talk to the girl and her family (if safe to do so)
to explain what's happening. **Do not do this yourself if it might place
anyone at risk** --- speak to your supervising social worker first.

## 🛡️ What Happens Next?

The police will trigger a **multi-agency safeguarding response**, which
may include:

-   Protecting the girl or other children at risk
-   A potential criminal investigation
-   Health and emotional support

The girl's welfare and safety are always the top priority.

## 🧾 FGM Protection Orders

In some cases, the local authority or police may apply for an **FGM
Protection Order** to keep a girl (or her siblings) safe. This is a
legal tool to prevent further harm.

## ⚠️ If You Don't Report

Not reporting a known case of FGM is a **serious safeguarding breach**.
It will be dealt with under the agency's disciplinary procedures and,
where applicable, referred to your professional body.
