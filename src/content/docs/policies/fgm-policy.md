title: FGM Policy
---


Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is illegal in England and Wales under
the FGM Act 2003 ("the 2003 Act"). It is a form of child abuse and
violence against women. FGM comprises all procedures involving partial
or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical
reasons.

Section 5B of the 2003 Act1 introduces a mandatory reporting duty which
requires regulated health and social care professionals and teachers in
England and Wales to report 'known' cases of FGM in under 18s which they
identify in the course of their professional work to the police. The
duty applies from 31 October 2015 onwards.

'Known' cases are those where either a girl informs the person that an
act of FGM -- however described -- has been carried out on her, or where
the person observes physical signs on a girl appearing to show that an
act of FGM has been carried out and the person has no reason to believe
that the act was, or was part of, a surgical operation within section
1(2)(a) or (b) of the FGM Act 20032 .

When a report must be made The FGM mandatory reporting duty is a legal
duty provided for in the FGM Act 2003 (as amended by the Serious Crime
Act 2015). The legislation requires regulated health and social care
professionals and teachers in England and Wales to make a report to the
police where, in the course of their professional duties, they either:

 are informed by a girl under 18 that an act of FGM has been carried
out on her; or

 observe physical signs which appear to show that an act of FGM has
been carried out on a girl under 18 and they have no reason to believe
that the act was necessary for the girl's physical or mental health or
for purposes connected with labour or birth.

For the purposes of the duty, the relevant age is the girl's age at the
time of the disclosure/identification of FGM (i.e. it does not apply
where a woman aged 18 or over discloses she had FGM when she was under
18).

Complying with the duty does not breach any confidentiality requirement
or other restriction on disclosure which might otherwise apply.

The duty is a personal duty which requires the individual professional
who becomes aware of the case to make a report; the responsibility
cannot be transferred. The only exception to this is if you know that
another individual from your profession has already made a report; there
is no requirement to make a second.

The duty does not apply in relation to at risk or suspected cases or in
cases where the woman is over 18.

In these cases, you should follow local safeguarding procedures. For
more information, please see the English or Welsh version of Working
Together to Safeguard Children as appropriate, and/or the multi-agency
guidance on FGM.

Where there is a risk to life or likelihood of serious immediate harm,
foster carers, social workers and professionals should report the case
immediately to police, including dialling 999 if appropriate.

## Timeframe

for reports Reports under the duty should be made as soon as possible
after a case is discovered, and best practice is for reports to be made
by the close of the next working day, unless any of the factors
described below are present. You should act with at least the same
urgency as is required by your local safeguarding processes.

## Making a report (a)

Where you become aware of a case, the legislation requires you to make a
report to the police force area within which the girl resides. The
legislation allows for reports to be made orally or in writing.

When you make a report to the police, the legislation requires you to
identify the girl and explain why the report is being made. While the
requirement to notify the police of this information is mandatory and
overrides any restriction on disclosure which might otherwise apply, in
handling and sharing information in all other contexts you should
continue to have regard to relevant legislation and guidance, including
the Data Protection Act 1998 and any guidance for your profession. The
provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 do not prevent a mandatory
report to the police from being made.

While the legislation requires a report to be made to the police, it
does not specify the process for making the report. If you have a formal
agreement with the relevant team in the police that reports can be made
to them directly, then reports may be made this way. In all cases you
should ensure that you are given a reference number for the case and
that you keep a record of it.

## Making a report (b)

It is recommended that you make a report orally by calling 101, the
single non-emergency number.

When you call 101, the system will determine your location and connect
you to the police force covering that area. You will hear a recorded
message announcing the police force you are being connected to. You will
then be given a choice of which force to be connected to -- if you are
calling with a report relating to an area outside the force area which
you are calling from, you can ask to be directed to that force.

Calls to 101 are answered by trained police officers and staff in the
control room of the local police force. The call handler will log the
call and refer it to the relevant team within the force, who will call
you back to ask for additional information and discuss the case in more
detail.

You should be prepared to provide the call handler with the following
information:

explain that you are making a report under the FGM mandatory reporting
duty

 your details: o name o contact details (work telephone number and
e-mail address) and times when you will be available to be called back o
role o place of work

 details of your organisation's designated safeguarding lead: o name o
contact details (work telephone number and e-mail address) o place of
work

 the girl's details: o name o age/date of birth o address

 if applicable, confirm that you have undertaken, or will undertake,
safeguarding actions, as required by the English or Welsh version of
Working Together to Safeguard Children as appropriate.

You will be given a reference number for the call and should ensure that
you document this in your records.

## Record keeping

Throughout the process, you should ensure that you keep a comprehensive
record of any discussions held and subsequent decisions made, in line
with standard safeguarding practice. This will include the circumstances
surrounding the initial identification or disclosure of FGM, details of
any safeguarding actions which were taken, and when and how you reported
the case to the police (including the case reference number). You should
also ensure that your supervising social worker and Wholistic Fostering
designated safeguarding lead is kept updated as appropriate.

## Informing the child's family

In line with safeguarding best practice, your supervising social worker
should ensure that the LA social worker has contacted the girl and/or
her parents or guardians as appropriate to explain the report, why it is
being made, and what it means. Wherever possible, you should have this
discussion in advance of/in parallel to the report being made. Advice
and support on how to talk to girls and parents/guardians about FGM is
available in the multi-agency guidance on FGM.

As a foster carer you will need to be aware that informing the
child/parents about the report may result in a risk of serious harm to
the child or anyone else, or of the family fleeing the country, . If you
are unsure or have concerns, you should discuss these with your
supervising social worker.

## Next steps following a report

Upon receipt of a report, the police will record the information and
initiate the multi-agency response, in line with local safeguarding
arrangements. Exact procedures will vary across local areas. If the
police consider that emergency action is needed to protect the child,
they may take action in advance of the multi-agency response.

While the multi-agency response will be initiated by the police, as they
are the agency receiving the report, they will consult children's social
care prior to taking action.

Factors considered may include:

 measures necessary to protect the girl/others identified as being at
risk of harm (children's social care lead);

 possible criminal investigation (police lead); and

 the health and wellbeing requirements of the girl/others, including
how the care will be delivered (health lead).

The protection of the child must be paramount at all times. The
multi-agency response should consider any wider health or emotional
support that the child may need. In considering the case and next steps,
local safeguarding processes should continue to be followed, in line
with wider relevant guidance, including: the Working Together to
Safeguard Children as appropriate, the multi-agency guidance on FGM,
information sharing, and, for the police, the authorised professional
practice on FGM.

## FGM Protection Orders

Depending on the circumstances of the case, the police or local
authority may wish to consider applying for an FGM Protection Order
(FGMPO) either to protect the girl or to protect other girls who may be
at risk (e.g. siblings). An FGMPO is a civil order which may be made for
the purposes of protecting a girl at risk of FGM or protecting a girl
against whom an FGM offence has been committed.

## Failure to comply with the duty

Cases of failure to comply with the duty will be dealt with in
accordance with the existing performance procedures in place for each
profession. FGM is child abuse, and employers and the professional
regulators are expected to pay due regard to the seriousness of breaches
of the duty.
