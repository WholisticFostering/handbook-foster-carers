title: 🏠 Placements with Foster Parents
---


## 📘 Scope

This policy explains how foster placements are matched, planned,
started, and ended. All placements must be made with approved Wholistic
Fostering (WF) carers within their terms of approval.

## 📞 Referral Process

WF only accepts referrals from local authorities. Referrers must
provide:

-   Purpose and timescale of placement
-   The child's Care Plan and contact arrangements
-   Risk assessments and known wishes/feelings

In emergencies, partial information may be accepted. Full details must
follow within 5 working days, or the Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO)
will be contacted.

## 🔍 Matching Process

Referrals are reviewed by WF's Duty Worker and Fostering Manager. We
assess:

-   The child's needs (school, health, contact, identity, behaviour)
-   Carer's experience, availability, household makeup
-   Distance from child's school

We won't propose placements if needs cannot be met, even with support. A
Planning Meeting or professionals' discussion may occur for complex
needs.

## 📝 Placement Planning

Before placement (or within 5 days for emergencies), a Planning Meeting
must:

-   Share all relevant info with carers
-   Agree on Placement Plan (including health, education, contact,
    behaviour)
-   Clarify delegated authority and safeguarding actions
-   Discuss independence plans if age-appropriate

The child's social worker must provide:

-   Care Plan
-   Chronology and relevant reports
-   Signed medical consents

## 🧸 Preparing the Child

Children should:

-   Receive the Children's Guide and Complaints Procedure
-   Have a chance to visit or receive info about carers beforehand

Carers should:

-   Explain routines and expectations
-   Encourage children to express views

If introductions aren't possible (e.g. emergencies), information must be
provided ASAP.

## 📢 Notifying the Placement

The placing authority must notify:

-   Health and education teams
-   The local authority where the child lives
-   The Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO)

## 🩺 Health Registration

The child must be registered with a local GP, dentist, and optician. If
it's the first time in care, a Health Assessment must be arranged to
inform the child's Health Plan.

## 🛑 Ending Placements

Placements may only end for:

-   Planned Care/Pathway Plan reasons
-   To protect the child or others
-   Emergency safeguarding reasons

Moves must consider the child's wishes. If another WF carer is being
considered, treat as a new placement. WF will involve the IRO if the
placing authority ends the placement unexpectedly.

Carers are encouraged to stay in touch after children move on.

## 💼 Support & Administration

WF ensures carers:

-   Receive timely support and supervision
-   Have prompt payment arrangements
