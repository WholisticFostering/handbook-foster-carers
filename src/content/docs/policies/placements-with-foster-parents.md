title: Placements with Foster Parents
---


## - Scope

This chapter explains the arrangements that need to be in place for the
matching and initial planning of placements, including introductions and
the drawing up of Placement Agreements/Placement Plans. It also includes
arrangements where placements end.

Placements will only be made with carers who have been approved by WF
(within their terms of approval) and who have signed a Foster Care
Agreement.

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 11, Preparation for placement (

      * Standard 15, Matching the child with a placement that meets their needs.
      * Standard 31, Placement Plan and Review
      * Standard 10 Providing a Suitable Physical Environment for the Foster Child

## - Initial Referral Process

WF will only accept referrals for placements from local authorities.

Where a referral is made, the referring local authority will be
requested to provide information as to the following:

      * i. The purpose of the placement
      * ii. The Care Plan, including issues around contact.
      * iii. Time scales
      * iv. Any risk assessments that have been prepared in relation to the child
      * v. A description of the child’s wishes and feelings and relevant others.

In the case of an emergency placement where it is not possible for the
referring local authority to provide the above information at the time
of the referral, they will be asked to provide as much information as is
available and, if the placement goes ahead, they will be asked to
provide full information within 5 working days of the placement.

Any information that is not provided within those timescales will then
be requested from the social worker's manager and if it is still not
provided the name of the child's Independent Reviewing Officer will be
requested and s/he will be contacted by the foster carer's Supervising
Social Worker.

It is particularly important for WF and in particular the carer, to have
all information about the child and their family which would hinder the
carer in providing a safe environment for the child and others in the
household.

## - Matching Process

The referral should be considered immediately by the Duty worker and the
Fostering Manager. The Duty worker will then liaise with the referring
local authority as necessary. As part of this exchange, information
about proposed foster carers will be provided to the referring local
authority in order to consider whether the carers can reasonably be
expected to meet the child's assessed needs, taking into account the
impact of the proposed placement on existing members of the household.

Each child over 3 will have their own bedroom or, where this is not
possible; the sharing of the bedroom will be agreed by the Placing
Authority.

Any child with known middle ear or respiratory tract infections, or who
is prone to asthma and bronchitis, will not be offered a placement in a
smoking household, although exceptions may be made where it is in the
child\'s best interests.

The various placement options should be discussed with the referring
Local Authority and a professionals\' planning meeting can also be
convened at this stage if required, for example, if a child has complex
needs.

The matching process should consider the child\'s needs especially
regarding the following key areas:

      * Schooling (note that where a child in key year 10 or 11 is moving to a placement which will disrupt his or her education, the approval of the Placing Authority’s Nominated Officer is required).
      *  Expectations around contact with the child’s family, particularly in relation to the foster carers’ part in facilitating and/or supervising such contact
      *  The child’s identity/race/culture
      *  The child’s history
      *  The child’s behaviour
      *  The child’s health
      *  The focus of the placement.

The matching process should also consider the carer\'s availability and:

      *  Their experience
      *  Their strengths
      *  Their address and the distance from the foster home to the child’s school
      *  Any other children in the placement
      *  The foster carers’ own children and other family members.

All the various parties involved in the matching process should feedback
to the proposed carer's and/or the Fostering Manager with any problems
and gaps identified between the needs of the child and the carer's
ability to meet them. An action plan should be agreed to see if any of
the outstanding issues can be resolved, such as transport difficulties
or trans-racial issues, and the agreement of the carers and the
Supervising Social Worker to the plan sought.

WF will not propose a placement if the assessed needs of the child
cannot, with support, be provided by the proposed foster carers.

The child\'s social worker should be advised to contact or visit
potential carers prior to a decision about a placement being made.

Once the child\'s needs have been matched with the carers and a viable
action plan agreed (to resolve any unmatched needs or outstanding
issues), the placement match should be passed to the Fostering Manager
for final agreement before it is confirmed to the referring local
authority.

## - Placement Process

### - Placement Planning

Once a decision has been made to make a placement, and where time allows
a pre-placement planning meeting should take place between the foster
carers, the Supervising Social Worker and the Placing Local Authority.
If appropriate the child and his/her family/significant others should
attend.

This meeting must consider and agree the detailed placement arrangements
for the child.

Where it is not possible to hold a pre-placement planning meeting, for
example where the placement has to be made in an emergency, a planning
meeting must take place within 5 working days of the placement.

The main purpose of the planning meeting is to share full information
about the child with the foster carers and agree the contents of the
Placement Agreement/Placement Plan which will include confirmation of
the following arrangements:

      * Registration of the child with local health professionals (GP, Dentist & Optician) and arrangements for the child’s health care (including the administration of medication). Any other health professionals involved will be informed of the placement by the Placing Authority and a decision made by the relevant health trust with regard to future plans for their continued involvement or moving to a more local provision.
      * Signed medical consent from the Placing Authority and parents if appropriate.
      * Plans for the child’s schooling and educational needs, including seeking the role of the foster carer in implementing the child’s Personal Education Plan, Statement of Special Educational Needs (where applicable), any extra educational support, etc. This should include the education arrangements for children under 5 and the training or educational requirements of those over 16.
      * Regularity of visits from the Placing Authority’s social worker. (These should take place within one week of the placement and thereafter at least every six weeks (unless the placement is to last until the child is 18 in which case after the first year visits can be at least every three months)
      * If appropriate, details of contact arrangements with family members/significant others (including whether the foster carer has delegated authority to make arrangements for the child’s social visits to friends and relatives including overnight stays).
      * Any specific cultural, religious or dietary needs of the child.
      * Any behaviour management issues
      * Where the proposed placement relates to a young person whose plan includes leaving care, arrangements should be in place for their preparation for independence including their Pathway Plan.
      * The steps that the fostering agency will take if reviews and visits do not take place within the designated timescales, for example contacting the child’s Independent Reviewing Officer

The planning meeting will also agree whether there will be a period of
introduction for the child prior to the placement -- see Section 3.3,
Introductions.

As well as providing the Placement Agreement/Placement Plan, the child's
social worker should also be requested to provide as much information
about the child as possible, for example:

      * The Chronology of significant events in the child’s life.
      * A copy of the Care Plan.
      * Any other relevant information about the child. For example, recent Looked After Review reports, Pathway Plan, Personal Education Plan, reports from specialists or therapists.

### - Placement Preparation

It is the aim of WF to make moving a positive experience for each
child/young person. Whilst appreciating it is an apprehensive and
stressful time, WF will endeavour to minimise the effects upon each
child and help them to settle into their new home as effortlessly as
possible.

Once the placement has been identified, the Supervising Social Worker
should ensure that the child has a copy of the Children\'s Guide within
which there are details regarding the Complaints Procedure. A copy of
the complaints procedure should be provided to the parents.

Wherever possible, arrangements should be made for the child, parents or
carers and the social worker to visit the foster home prior to the
placement. If this is not possible, arrangements may be made for the
carers to visit the child and parents or carers; or, as a minimum, for
information about the foster carers to be sent to the child -- see 3.3,
Introductions.

If none of these arrangements can be made, for example where the child
is being placed in an emergency or at short notice, extra care must be
taken in case the child is frightened or confused, and the information
described above should be provided to the child as soon as possible
after the placement.

The Placement Agreement/Placement Plan will be drawn up by the child's
social worker as agreed at the planning meeting and this should be
provided to the foster carer and Supervising Social Worker by the
child's social worker prior to or within 5 working days of the
placement, together with a copy of the child's Care Plan and the other
written information about the child as agreed at the placement planning
meeting.

### - Introductions

Wherever possible there should be a period of introductions between the
child and the foster carers.

This should involve the following:

      * The child receiving information about the foster home including a profile of the foster carers and members of their household and family network and ;
      * A meeting between the child and the carers, preferably at the foster home, as an initial introduction during which the child can become familiar with the house and the household;
      * Ideally, the child having at least one overnight visit before a placement is confirmed.

Throughout the introduction process carers will discuss issues with the
child regarding routines within the placement, information about
bedtimes, meals, visitors, pocket money, school, privacy and the overall
expectations regarding behaviour within the placement. Equally, the
child is encouraged to discuss their views and what expectations they
have in an effort to resolve any uncertainties/concerns at the outset
and to reinforce transparency and honesty to the child.

### - Notification of Placement

Notification of the placement must be sent, by the Placing Authority to
all those consulted and involved in the decision-making process.

The Placing Authority must also notify the following:

      - The service within the local authority responsible for arranging Looked After Reviews.
      - The relevant Health Trust, Education Service and the Local Authority’s Children's Services in the area where the child is placed; these notifications must be made in writing advising of the placement decision and the name and address of the person with whom the child is to be placed.

### - Health Care Assessments

It will necessary for the child's social worker to ensure the child is
registered with a GP, Dentist and Optician, either retaining practices
known to them or in the area where they are placed. This is usually
covered in the child's Placement Agreement/Placement Plan --[see 3.1,
Placement
Planning](/policies/placements_with_foster_parents#placement-planning).

Where it is the child's first placement as a looked after child, it will
also be necessary for the child's social worker to arrange a Health Care
Assessment so that a Health Care Plan can be drawn up in time for the
first Looked After Review. If the child's social worker agrees, these
arrangements may be undertaken by the foster carer and will be covered
in the Placement Agreement/Placement Plan.

## - Ending Placements and Placement Moves within the Agency

Placements will not be ended by WF for reasons other than:

      * The end of the placement is within the child’s Care and Placement Plan or Pathway Plan.
      * To protect the child.
      * To protect the other members of the household.
      * In an emergency where other more suitable arrangements to maintain the placement cannot be made.

If the Placing Authority is proposing to end the placement for reasons
other than those stated above, WF will inform the child's Independent
Reviewing Officer.

Whenever a placement move is being considered the wishes and feelings of
the child must be obtained and considered. Where their wishes and
feelings are not being observed the reasons for this must be explained
to them. Children should not move placements until they have had a
chance to express their view and they have been given an explanation
that they can understand of the reasons for the move.

If a move to another carer within WF is being considered, this will be
treated as a move to a new placement.

Foster parents will be encouraged wherever possible to be able to
maintain contact with placed children and young people who have moved
on.

## - Administration

The fostering agency will make arrangements to support the carer with
the placement including making arrangements for the appropriate payments
to be made promptly.
