title: Children missing from care
---


## Scope

This chapter explains how carers and staff should deal with children
when they go missing. This chapter should be read in conjunction with
the Local Safeguarding Children Board Inter Agency Safeguarding
Procedures and Protocols.

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 5 Missing From Care

## Introduction

Foster carers will work with children in the foster home to help them to
feel safe enough in to stay in the placement. Foster carers will work
positively with children to prevent them running away.

WF will always follow the guidance contained within in the Local
Safeguarding Children Board Procedures and Protocols for Young Runaways
and Children Missing from Home and Care.

A preventative, educative approach is expected from foster carers
encouraging them to deal with situations where the missing child's
whereabouts are known and to work alongside the Police.

On their return the child must be seen alone by an independent person
and a return home interview undertaken. The foster carer must work with
the placing authority (child's social worker) and WF to create a
strategy to keep the child safe in future.

## Definition of Missing Child

The terms 'Missing' or 'Absconding' means:

      * A child who is absent from his/her placement and whose whereabouts are unknown. This includes a child who may have been abducted.
      * A child who is absent from his/her placement without the agreement of the carers but whose whereabouts are known or suspected.
      * A child who is Remanded or otherwise Lawfully Detained in Local Authority Accommodation and is absent without Authority or Missing from the placement.

## Planning and Prevention

As part of the referral, placement and ongoing planning process,
consideration must be given to the risk of the child becoming missing.
If there is a risk, a plan must be drawn up to reduce or prevent it. WF
will ensue that this is discussed and developed at placement planning
meetings and reviewed at each LAC review.

Foster carers should know when to try to prevent a child or young person
leaving the home and should do so through dialogue, but they should not
try to restrain the child should they be intent on leaving, or in any
other circumstances, unless it is necessary to prevent injury to the
child or others, or serious damage to property.

On a day to day basis, carers should be alert to signs or indications
that a child may be likely to \'run away\' or become missing. If carers
suspect that this may happen, they should take any actions already
agreed with the Supervising Social Worker and the child's social worker,
or do what they reasonably and safely can to reduce or prevent the child
from leaving - this includes circumstances where a child is refusing to
return to the home.

If the risk increases, they should contact the Supervising Social Worker
or, if out of hours, the on-call Social Worker for advice.

If there is a serious risk e.g. the child is behaving in a violent
manner or threatening to damage property, the carer should contact the
Police, then contact the Supervising Social Worker at the first
opportunity.

## If the Child is missing

In the event of a child being absent without permission the foster carer
should:

      * Make attempts to locate the child i.e. telephone all known contacts of the said child e.g. their school, friends, parental addresses and shops and if able to visit all known places they may be i.e. playgrounds, friend’s homes, local areas where groups of children congregate.
      * If the child is not found within a reasonable time frame: one hour for under 12's and two hours for over 12's (unless stated otherwise in their Placement Agreement/Placement Plan), report the child missing to the local Police and the child's Local Authority (social worker/Duty/EDT). It is the carer's responsibility to ensure they have these numbers available to them.
      * Complete a [[http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp07-child-missing-from-placement-notification/|Child Missing from Placement Record]] detailing the date, time, and description of the circumstances prior to the child absconding, note all people notified and required action. Note the time the young person returned and circumstances. Note any reasons the young person gave for being absent.
      * Send the Report to their Supervising Social Worker or the Fostering Service Manager as a matter of urgency.

At no time should the foster carer pass any information to the press.
All information should only be shared between the Local Authority,
Police and the Fostering Service Manager.

The Fostering Service Manager will arrange to log this information for
monitoring purposes. A copy of the report will be retained on the
child's file and a copy forwarded to the child's social worker. A copy
of the report will also be sent to Regulatory Authority in accordance
with Schedule 7 of the Fostering Service Regulations (see [Notification
Procedure](/procedures/notifications_of_significant_events_to_other_agencies)).

It will be the responsibility of the child\'s social worker or Local
Authority EDT to inform the child's parents where appropriate.

Once the child has been reported missing, the police will interview the
foster carer to obtain relevant information including the child\'s
details, name date of birth, hair/skin/eye colour, distinguishing
features, any disabilities, clothing and jewellery believed to be worn.
A recent photograph may be required. Carers should be aware that the
police have the right to search their property and may do so to
ascertain that the child is still missing and not just hiding.

The foster carer should take the following steps when a child returns
after an unauthorised absence:

      * Assess the child’s immediate needs i.e. offer something to eat, does the child need a shower/bath and a clean change of clothes? Is there any need for medical treatment?
      * Explain to the child that they do not want them to go missing but they will be welcomed back to the household.
      * Try to gain an insight into the young person’s absence and what can be done to minimise its recurrence, although it is acknowledged that the point at which the child returns may or may not be the best time to try to discuss the reasons why the child has gone missing.
      * Inform all relevant professionals i.e. police (unless they returned the child),
      * Fostering Service Manager and the child’s Local Authority that the child has returned.
      * A missing from care return interview will be completed with the child or young person.

Should there be any suspicion that the unauthorised absence is linked to
an abusive incident; the Child Protection Referral Procedure should be
invoked.

# A Safe and Well Check

A safe and well check should be carried out by the police as soon as
possible after a child who has been reported missing has been found.

# Return Interview

\<font 16px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff\>On the child\'s return, as soon as
practicable, an independent person //Designation Required // (NOT the
Supervising Social Worker or the foster parent), will interview the
child and complete a Return Interview.\</font\>
