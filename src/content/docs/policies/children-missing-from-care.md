lastUpdated: 2025-06-28

## 📘 Scope

This chapter outlines how foster carers and staff should respond when a
child goes missing from care. It must be read in conjunction with your
Local Safeguarding Children Board's (LSCB) Inter-Agency Safeguarding
Procedures and Protocols.

It reflects the Fostering Services National Minimum Standards and
Regulations 2011 -- Standard 5: \*Missing from Care\*.

## 🧭 Introduction

Wholistic Fostering is committed to keeping children safe. Our foster
carers work proactively with young people to build trust and prevent
running away incidents.

Carers must follow the local LSCB's procedures for young runaways and
missing children. They are expected to act preventively and supportively
--- using education, understanding and partnership with police and
professionals.

After any missing episode, the child must be seen alone by an
independent person for a **return home interview**, and a safety
strategy must be reviewed with the placing authority.

## ❓ What Does "Missing" Mean?

A child may be considered missing when:

-   They are away from their placement and their whereabouts are
    unknown.
-   They are absent without agreement, but their location is suspected.
-   They are remanded or lawfully detained in care and leave the
    placement without authority.

## 🛡️ Prevention & Planning

From the start of any placement, carers and staff must assess the
likelihood of a child going missing and agree steps to reduce that risk.
This should be discussed during:

-   Referral and placement planning.
-   Placement Planning Meetings.
-   LAC Reviews.

Carers should:

-   Engage the child in open, daily dialogue.
-   Never restrain a child unless necessary to prevent harm.
-   Alert their Supervising Social Worker if risks increase.
-   Call the out-of-hours worker if needed.
-   In emergencies (e.g. violence or threats), contact the **police
    first**, then WF staff.

## 🚫 If a Child Goes Missing

Carers should take the following steps:

**1. Immediate Search**

-   Attempt to contact the child.
-   Call known contacts (e.g. friends, school, relatives).
-   Check local hangouts, parks, shops.

**2. Report the Child Missing**

-   If the child is not located within:
    1.  1 hour (under 12s)
    2.  2 hours (over 12s)
-   Or as per their Placement Plan:
    1.  Report them to the **Police**
    2.  Notify the child's **Social Worker / Duty Team / EDT**

**3. Record the Incident**

-   Complete the WF online form:

      [[http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp07-child-missing-from-placement-notification/|Child Missing from Placement Record]]
    * Include: time, description, actions taken, notifications made, and reasons given by the child on return.
    * Send to your **Supervising Social Worker** or **Fostering Service Manager** promptly.

**4. Confidentiality**

-   Do not speak to the press.
-   Share information only with:
    1.  Local Authority
    2.  Police
    3.  Fostering Service Manager

## 🧾 On the Child's Return

Carers should:

-   Meet immediate needs (food, clothes, hygiene, rest).
-   Offer reassurance --- they are welcome back.
-   Gently explore why they went missing (only if appropriate).
-   Notify:
    1.  Police (unless they returned the child)
    2.  WF Fostering Manager
    3.  Local Authority / Social Worker

```{=html}

```
-   Support arrangements for a **Return Interview** by an independent
    person (not the carer or SSW).

If the absence may relate to abuse, invoke the [🛡️ Child Protection
Procedure](/policies/child-protection).

## 🔎 Safe & Well Checks

Police should carry out a **Safe & Well Check** promptly after a child
returns. This is to ensure they are not at risk of harm and understand
what happened.

## 💬 Return Interview

A **Return Interview** must be arranged by the Local Authority. It
should be:

-   Conducted by an **independent person** (not the foster carer or
    SSW).
-   Focused on understanding the child's reasons for leaving and how to
    reduce future risk.
