title: Supervision and Safeguarding of Children in Need and in Need of Protection
---


It is important that all managers and employees working with children,
young people and foster carers (directly or indirectly) have read the WF
\[Child Protection Policy\] and that this is referred to as necessary.

      * For many practitioners involved in day to day work with children and families, effective supervision is important to promoting good standards of practice and to supporting individual staff members. Supervision should help to ensure that practice is soundly based and consistent with WF’s procedures. It should ensure that practitioners fully understand their roles, responsibilities and the scope of their professional discretion and authority. It should also help identify the training and development needs of practitioners, so that each has the skills to provide an effective service.
      * Supervision should include scrutinising and evaluating the work carried out, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the practitioner and providing coaching development and pastoral support. Supervisors should be available to practitioners as an important source of advice and expertise and may be required to endorse judgements at certain key points in child protection processes. Supervisors should also record key decisions within case records.
