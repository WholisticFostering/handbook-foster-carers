title: Guidance for Transracial Placements
---


## Introduction

This document provides guidance with regard to Transracial placement.
Transracial placement is the placement of looked after children and
young people with foster carers of a different racial background.

Due to the individual nature of each case this guidance aims not to be
prescriptive but rather to raise awareness and provide a framework to
assist those making placements to consider how to plan what is best for
each child.

## Legislation and Guidance

### Article 20 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child

This Article states that: 'A child temporarily or permanently deprived
of his or her family environment, or in whose best interests cannot be
allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special
protection and assistance provided by the state. When considering
solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in
a child's upbringing and to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and
linguistic background.'

### Section 22 of the Children Act 1989

This requires local authorities to give due consideration to: The
child's religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic
background. (Section 22(5) (a))

### The Guidance to the Children Act 1989

This states that: 'It may be taken as a guiding principle of good
practice that, all things being equal and in the great majority of
cases, placement with a family of similar ethnic origin and religion is
most likely to meet a child's needs as fully as possible and to
safeguard his or her welfare most effectively.' (Vol 3, 2.40)

### Local Authority Circular 20 (98): 'Adoption - Achieving the Right Balance' This states that:

'Choice of placement should also take account of a child\'s previous
family experience and his or her wishes and feelings while recognising
that their wishes and feelings may be restrictive or unrealistic.
Placement with a family of similar ethnic origin and religion is very
often most likely to meet the child\'s needs as fully as possible,
safeguarding his welfare most effectively and preparing him for life as
a member of a multi-racial society. These are, however, only some among
a number of other significant factors and should not of themselves be
regarded as the decisive ones.

Where no family can be identified which matches significantly closely to
the child\'s ethnic origin and cultural heritage, the agency\'s efforts
to find an alternative suitable family should be proactive and diligent;
this work should also include setting agreed and realistic time limits
to avoid a child having to wait indefinitely. A child\'s concept of time
differs considerably from that of an adult.'

The Government has made it clear that it is unacceptable for a child to
be denied loving carers solely on the grounds that the child and carers
do not share the same racial or cultural background.

## Principles

### Duty of foster families

All foster families should assist children placed with them to
understand and appreciate their background and culture; this can include
providing opportunities for children to meet others from similar
backgrounds, to practice their religion, both in a formal place of
worship and in the home. Maintaining continuity of the heritage of their
birth family in their day-to-day life is important to most children; it
is a means of retaining knowledge of their identity and feeling that
although they have left their birth family they have not abandoned
important cultural, religious or linguistic values of their community.
This will be of particular significance as they reach adulthood.

### Identity

Children develop their sense of identity from the environment in which
they live and the role models and relationships that are significant in
their lives. The identity of a child from the majority groups develops
partly from seeing that they are the same as others in the dominant
majority, assuming they have the same rights and can realise the same
achievements and acquire the same status. This is likely to instil a
positive sense of confidence and self-esteem.

Children from minority groups observe that others like them may be less
likely to be in positions of power and control and will see and or
experience the prejudice and discrimination that exists towards those
who are the same as them. Unless this imbalance is redressed this will
impact adversely on the child's self-image and confidence. This can be
compounded for a child in care who has been removed from a parent from
the minority group ("the bad parent") and placed with a carer from the
majority group ("the good parent").

The development of a positive racial identity is extremely important to
the overall well being of a child or young person, and a positive
identity is unlikely to be acquired without positive support and
reinforcement.

Life story work is a very important tool to assist a children or young
person in understanding and feeling positive about their identity.
Various forms of support including advocacy and mentoring may be offered
to children and young people who have difficulties with their identity.
The department should aim to ensure that support is provided by a staff
team who have the expertise to address these issues.

### Challenging racism

The effects of racism and stereotyping are often subtle and insidious
and negative beliefs are not only held by some of the majority
population but may also become internalised by minority groups who may
acquire negative feelings about themselves or people from other ethnic
minority groups.

Where either apparent or covert racism is perceived to be part of the
attitude or behaviour of anyone involved with the care and placement of
looked after children this must be challenged in accordance with any
policy and/or regulations that applies to their role.

### Children of mixed parentage

Like all children and young people, children and young people of mixed
parentage should wherever possible be placed with families who reflect
their ethnicity e.g. with a carer who is also of mixed parentage or with
a couple who between them reflect thechild or young person's ethnic mix.

Where this is not possible the wider needs of that child or young person
need to taken into consideration. A child or young person of mixed
parentage who is positive about their ethnicity should feel comfortable
being placed with carers who reflect either part of their ethnicity.
However this may not always be the case if perhaps that person has only
experienced being cared for by one parent. It may then be more
appropriate to make a placement with a carer who is of the same
ethnicity of that child or young person's main caring parent. The
decision should take into account the wishes and feelings of the child
or young person and also those of his parent(s).

When a child or young person is placed with a carer who does not reflect
their ethnicity that carer should have a good understanding of the
issues that face children and young people of mixed parentage and be
competent to meet the child or young person's needs. Where a child or
young person does not have a positive self-image, work should be
undertaken to enable that person to feel positive and be comfortable
with their identity.

Where a child of mixed parentage (non-white) or the parent of a child of
mixed parentage does not acknowledge the full ethnicity of the child,
efforts should be made to work with them to explore and resolve this.
The child and parent need to be supported to attain a positive view of
their origins and to acknowledge that in general someone of mixed
parentage will not be seen as being white by the wider society.

### Balancing the child's hierarchy of needs

To be placed with a family from the same or similar ethnic background
should be the key priority within the child's hierarchy of needs. Family
finding should be undertaken to recruit carers from the same or similar
background.

However, where a child or young person has a diverse hierarchy of needs
these should be prioritised, taking into account the wishes and feelings
of the child or young person and his or her family. A "good enough
"match to the child's full range of needs should then be sought, with
each case being considered on its own merits.

Language for instance, the language needs of a child or young person
will have particular significance for someone who is newly arrived here
and if no appropriate placement is immediately available then a decision
will need to be made as to which aspect of a child's identity is to be
given precedence. For example a newly arrived black French speaking
child from Zaire could feel most comfortable with another black African
family even though they were non French speaking but with whom they are
more likely to share some racial and cultural similarity than with a
French speaking white family. Any such decision should be led by the
wishes of the child or young person where ever this is possible to do
so.

### Siblings

Siblings should always be placed together where possible and this may
only be possible with a foster family who do not match the ethnic origin
of the children to be accommodated. It is always preferable to keep
siblings together, particularly since a white sibling placed with a
family of a different ethnic origin will have easier access to white
culture and role models than his or her black/mixed parentage sibling is
likely to have to the minority culture. It is important that all
children within a family group with diverse origins are placed with a
family where all aspects of their background will be understood and
valued.

### Disability

Where a child or young person from an ethnic minority for instance has a
disability, learning difficulty or child mental health issue and it is
not possible to identify a carer from that same ethnic background with
relevant experience, it may well be more appropriate to make a placement
with a carer who has that experience and a good understanding of the
health and/or disability issues. Their ability to manage those matters
on a day to day basis and their ability to impact positively on that on
the child's quality of life would then be the overriding factor.

### Location

Location is an important issue for children and young people from
minority ethnic groups. Care should be taken not to place children and
young people in areas where they may feel isolated or vulnerable. For
instance it may not be in the best interests of a child or young person
from an ethnic minority to be placed in a predominately white rural
area.

### School

Continuity of school placement is also an important consideration. It is
desirable to maintain existing links with teachers and other school
staff on whom children may have to come to rely and identify with and to
enable them to continue their studies without a break.

### Religion

Defining suitability of placement with regard to religion may be a
complex issue. For example an Indian Muslim family and an Indian Sikh
child may well be described as of the same racial origin. However in
such circumstances the religious needs of the child may well take
precedence and although the match may be of the "same race" other
factors may actually make the placement inappropriate.

### Parental Contact

In some cases the need to safeguard the child or young person from
restricted or prohibited contact with parents or previous carers from
whom they have experienced harm must be an overriding priority. In these
circumstances the need to place children away from a particular locality
will be override other considerations.

Alternatively, where there is a requirement for frequent contact between
the child and their natural parents the choice of placement should not
unnecessarily restrict these arrangements. This may apply in contested
care proceedings

### Foster Parents (Carers)

Any foster parent or parent caring for a child or young person from a
different minority ethnic background should have the necessary skills,
attitudes, support network and knowledge to meet the child or young
person's needs. They must be able to demonstrate that:

      * They have a good understanding of the nature of prejudice, discrimination and racism,
      * They are able to prepare a child to deal with discrimination,
      * They are able to provide a positive environment and opportunities for that child or young person to have contact with people from the same community.

The following issues should be considered as part of any specific
assessment aimed at determining the suitability of any carer to look
after a child from a different ethnic background to their own:

      * Understanding and experience of other ethnicities, cultures and religions, • The motivation of the applicant and what support systems are in place, both for the child or young person and the carer,
      * Evaluation of the ethnic mix of the area in which they live and whether there will be role models and peers within the community,
      * The knowledge the applicant has of the background of any specific child or young person for whom placement is being considered, assessing whether they have the parenting capacity to support someone from a different background.
      * The ability to accommodate any requirements or needs the child or young person may have arising from their ethnic origins.
      * The capacity to help the child or young cope with the prejudice and discrimination they may encounter and put strategies in place both for the child or young person and themselves to deal with difficult situations.

### Training

Caring for children from different backgrounds, challenging racism and
implementing strategies for children and young people to deal with
racism is a core requirement of training programme for our foster
carers.

Carers must be able to show a sound level of understanding and meet the
recognised BAAF competency requirements in showing 'an ability to
promote equality, diversity, and rights of individuals and groups within
society.

All staff and managers should undertake regular training on issues of
equality. Managers should ensure that all workers involved in the making
or supporting of placements where children and young people are placed
transracially have the knowledge and competence to ensure that the
cultural, religious and linguistic needs of each child or young person
are met.

### Recording

Details of a child or young person's ethnicity, religion and language
must always be recorded correctly on the child or young person's file.
Any subsequent information that is verified and differs from the initial
recording must be added and the original entry amended as necessary.

All placements should take fully into account the child or young
person's race, ethnicity, culture, religious and linguistic background.

The specific needs of each child or young person must be identified in
all care plans and other written assessments.

Where possible all children and young people should be placed with
carers who reflect their identity.

### Emergency Placements

Although a child or young person's race, ethnicity, culture, religious
and linguistic background should always be given priority Wholistic
Fostering recognise that this will not always be possible in an
emergency when there are other important factors to consider, such as
the need to Safeguard a child.

Where it has not been possible for a child or young person to be placed
appropriately in an emergency such that their needs in terms of gender,
religion, ethnic origin, language, culture, disability and sexuality
cannot be adequately met, steps will be taken to achieve a suitable
placement as soon as possible. This may mean that the placing authority
will want to move the child to a placement outside of Wholistic
Fostering and as such we will deem to support this in the best interest
of the child.

### Short Term Placements

For any child who is likely to be looked after for longer than six
weeks, that child should be placed with a family who as closely as
possible match the ethnicity, culture, religious and linguistic
background of that child or young person as closely as possible, unless
another placement is deemed to be appropriate due to other factors in
the young person's hierarchy of needs taking preference. For instance
these may concern the child's educational or health needs, or
arrangements for contact with family.

The child's needs should then be more specifically considered within the
written foster placement agreement when the placement has been made. Any
deficits in the placement should be identified and plans made to address
any shortfall. For instance, if the child is of a different faith,
arrangements may need to be put in place to enable that child or young
person to practise their religion. Similarly, the carer may need advice
on hair and/or skin care, and there may need to be restrictions on the
way in which food is prepared.

### Conversion from Short Term to Permanency

In many cases a short term foster carer will express an interest in
coming forward to offer permanency to a child placed with them. When
this is a transracial placement careful consideration should be given to
such a plan. Any foster carer expressing an interest in a specific child
in these circumstances should be informed of the issues regarding
transracial placement as set put in this document.

Where an older child or young person's short term foster carer expresses
an interest in becoming the long term care for a child or young person
from a different background this should be given careful consideration
taking into consideration the wishes and feelings of that child or young
person and their family.

All carers wanting to convert a placement from short term to a permanent
arrangement will be reassessed focussing on their ability to care for
that particular child on a longterm basis. Where a child or young person
is from a different background the assessor should pay particular
attention to the carer's ability to meet that needs of a child or young
person placed transracially.

Efforts should be made to ensure that the child or young person feels
positive about their identity and any negative ideas they may hold in
relation to being placed with carers from their own ethnic background
should be addressed.

Efforts should also be made to ensure that the child or young person is
choosing to stay with the carers because he or she feels that they have
arrived somewhere where they feel comfortable and safe and are with
people who value and support their difference positively.
