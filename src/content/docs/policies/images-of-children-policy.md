title: 📸 Images of Children Policy
---


**Clear guidance on using photography and video with looked after
children --- protecting privacy, dignity, and memories.**

## 🧑‍💼 Guidance for Social Work Staff

The purpose of this policy is to:

-   Safeguard children and young people from misuse of photography
-   Provide clear, accountable practice for staff
-   Recognise that images can be essential for life story work and
    positive identity

### ✅ Key Protocol for Wholistic Staff

-   Photography or video must have a **clear, child-focused purpose**
-   Explain the purpose to the child in age-appropriate terms
-   Get **written consent** from the child's social worker or
    parent/carer (unless the young person is old enough to consent
    themselves)
-   Children must **never** be photographed against their will
-   Children must be **appropriately clothed**, respecting cultural and
    religious norms
-   Use **council equipment** or approved retail outlets for developing
    photos --- never use your own home
-   Do **not use personal mobile phones** to take pictures unless
    authorised in missing person protocols --- delete immediately
    afterward
-   Do **not store or keep images at home**
-   Do **not display photos** in public areas --- only in staff-only
    spaces
-   For **public use** (e.g. newsletters or events), get **specific
    written permission** from those with parental responsibility ---
    never include names
-   Do **not send images online** unless with parental consent and
    through secure, work-based systems
-   Store all images **securely** --- printed or digital
-   **Never post foster child images** on social media or networking
    sites

## 🏡 Guidance for Foster Carers

Foster carers play a key role in helping children:

-   Build memories through photos of their time in care
-   Fill gaps in their personal history
-   Develop a sense of pride in who they are

### 📘 Best Practice

-   Discuss use of photos at **placement planning meetings**
-   Respect a child's **wishes and comfort** --- never force photography
-   Never take photos of a child **unclothed or in private settings**
-   Set up a **photo album or digital folder** for each child --- this
    is their keepsake
-   Support older children to take and keep their own photos
-   If unsure, speak to your **supervising social worker**

### 🚫 Social Media Warning

Photos of looked after children **must not** be posted on social media,
including:

-   Facebook
-   Instagram
-   TikTok
-   BeBo
-   Any public online platforms

Children should also be **discouraged** from sharing their own images
online due to the **risk of exploitation, identity exposure, or
disruption to their placement.**
