title: 🚭 Smoking Policy
---


This policy outlines Wholistic Fostering's position on smoking in foster
homes, in line with legal requirements and best practice guidance to
promote children\'s health and wellbeing.

## 📘 Scope

This policy applies to:

-   All staff, applicants, and approved foster carers
-   All fostering placements
-   Use of tobacco and e-cigarettes

It is aligned with:

-   Children Act 1989
-   Adoption and Children Act 2002
-   Fostering Services National Minimum Standards (Standard 6)
-   BAAF Practice Note 51 -- Environmental Tobacco Smoke in Foster Care

## 🏥 Health & Legislation Context

Children in care are entitled to the same health outcomes as their
peers. Smoking is a key public health issue, and passive smoke
significantly harms children's health.

Key government targets include reducing smoking in pregnancy and overall
national smoking rates.

Local authorities must protect children in their care from unnecessary
health risks, including exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

## ⚖️ Policy Principles

-   Children under 5, and those with health issues (e.g. asthma, glue
    ear, heart or respiratory conditions), will **not normally be
    placed** with carers who smoke or live with smokers.
-   All cases are considered **individually**.
-   Smoking is **not an automatic bar** to fostering, but is a
    significant consideration.
-   Carers and applicants should be **informed early** in the assessment
    process about the policy.
-   The welfare of the child is **always the priority**.

## 🚬 Health Impact of Smoking

Passive smoking in children is linked to:

-   Increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
-   More frequent chest infections and asthma
-   Higher rates of ear infections, hearing loss, and speech delay
-   Greater likelihood of children viewing smoking as normal

Children with existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Guidance for Applicants & Carers

All applicants and foster carers who smoke or live with smokers will be
given information and support on:

-   The impact of smoking on children\'s health and development
-   The agency\'s position on not placing vulnerable children with
    smokers
-   Expectations around reducing smoking or creating smoke-free homes
-   Availability of support to quit smoking (GPs, NHS services, and
    charities such as \"Quit\")

The agency will assess:

-   Whether smoking takes place indoors or around children
-   Willingness to reduce or stop smoking
-   Household routines or safety measures in place

Where necessary, a brief report may be submitted to the Fostering Panel
and Medical Advisor to determine next steps.

## 🏠 Placements

Placement decisions will always be based on the individual needs of the
child. Exposure to secondhand smoke will be a key consideration.

The agency will not normally place:

-   Children under 5
-   Children with respiratory or heart conditions

With foster carers who smoke or live in a smoking household, except in
exceptional circumstances.

## 🔁 Reviews & Changes in Approval

Smoking status will be reviewed at:

-   Annual reviews
-   Placement planning and matching
-   Changes to the household

If carers or household members smoke, the SSW will discuss the
implications during the annual review. This will inform whether any
change is needed to the age range or type of children a carer can be
approved for.

## 💨 E-Cigarettes & Vaping

-   The agency currently classifies **vaping as smoking** for the
    purpose of placement decisions, due to lack of conclusive evidence
    about long-term effects.
-   Foster carers should **not vape in front of children or in the
    home**.
-   Carers will **not be excluded** from fostering based on e-cigarette
    use, but will be encouraged to reduce use where possible.
-   The agency will **review its position** on e-cigarettes annually as
    more evidence becomes available.

## 📌 Summary

This policy reflects Wholistic Fostering's commitment to children's
health and wellbeing. While smoking is not an automatic bar to
fostering, it is a key factor in placement decisions, especially for
vulnerable children.

Support will be offered to help carers make informed choices and create
smoke-free environments.
