## Background

This policy is intended for use by all staff employed with Focused
Fostering Services.

It is applicable to both prospective and existing foster carers.

Every Child Matters is the Government\'s statement and approach to the
welfare of all children and young people. One of the five key outcomes
for children and young people is: \"Be healthy\". The aspiration is that
children and young people should develop healthy lifestyles and
opportunities to achieve optimum health and well-being within the
context of high quality preventive and treatment services.

One of the outcome targets linked to the above and other initiatives
includes:

      * By 2010, reducing by 55,000 the number of women smoking when pregnant and the number of smokers generally by 1.5 million. 

There are specific health objectives for children looked after by local
authorities. Local authorities and Primary Care Trusts are required to
ensure that children looked after enjoy a standard of health and
development as good as all children of the same age living in the same
area.

For Focused Fostering one of the key corporate objectives is \"A place
where people can live healthy lives\".

The 1989 Children Act requires that the wellbeing of children who are
looked after is safeguarded and promoted. The physical, emotional and
health needs of each child are to be identified and appropriate action
taken to secure the medical, dental and other health services needed to
meet them.

Good practice guidance has outlined the need for clear policy in
relation to the issue of smoking in relation to the assessment of
potential carers and foster carers

Smoking is now one of the factors considered within the health
report/medical assessment of foster carers

## General Principles

      * In view of the risks to health for children aged under five years old, and for those with physical conditions which adversely affect their breathing, those with glue ear and children with heart disease - such children will not normally be placed with foster carers where the carers or other members of their household smoke, other than in exceptional circumstances. 
      * At all times the welfare of the child or young person is paramount
      * Disabled children and young people have the same rights as all other children and young people
      * All applications will be treated individually, on a case-by-case basis, regardless of whether or not the applicant/s or carers smoke.
      * Children, young people, parents and potential foster carers have individual values and beliefs and a right to their own views and preferences. These rights are acknowledged and respected within legal and professional boundaries. 
      * Potential foster carers should receive information, advice about any smoking behaviour at an early stage of an application.

## Smoking and Health

There are well-documented adverse health effects from smoking and these
are not only for smokers but for those affected by \"passive\" smoking.
Adverse effects have been known for many years but a number of studies
have demonstrated the effects of smoking on young children:

      * Compared to those infants whose mothers do not smoke, the infants of smoking mothers have almost five times the risk of dying from Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy.
      * Lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchitis) in pre-school children occur more frequently if a parent smokes. 
      * Asthma and respiratory infections in school-age children are more common in a smoking household. 
      * Parental smoking is responsible for a 20 - 40 per cent increased risk of middle-ear disease in children. This is associated with hearing loss, a need for surgery, secondary speech delay, schooling difficulties and social isolation. .

Additionally:

      * Children with breathing difficulties and specific medical conditions as a result of an underlying medical condition are more likely to be particularly vulnerable and experience an exacerbation of their condition as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke.

There is, therefore clear evidence that cigarette smoke is harmful to
young children, to those with breathing difficulties and other medical
conditions.

Additionally, as children copy the behaviour of adults it means that
\".. Growing up in a household where adults smoke often means that
children perceive smoking as the \"norm\".

## Advice to Prospective Foster Carers

As assessments will be dealt with on a case by case basis it is
important that each and every prospective assessment/assessment is
considered on its merits. It is important to balance positive qualities
of prospective foster carers who smoke against the adverse effects of
smoking upon children. Prospective carers should not be given the
impression if they smoke that they will automatically be excluded from
fostering. Primary consideration will be given to the welfare of the
child and smoking, whilst not a debarring factor to fostering, is an
important factor which is considered. Smoking should be covered at an
early stage with prospective carers. The discussion should centre on the
following:

      * The agency’s policy on smoking and fostering and specifically that unless there are exceptional circumstances a child aged under five years of age, children with breathing difficulties and certain medical conditions will not normally be placed with carers who smoke/where others within their household smoke.
      * The known effects of smoking on young children, children with breathing difficulties and certain medical conditions. 
      * How the effects of smoking on long term health might influence an assessment of suitability to adopt or recommendation for approval as a foster carer.
      * The need of the agency to treat the welfare of each child as paramount and to select the best possible placement available to meet each child's needs. It should be noted that in considering placement of a child, the child's best interest is served throughout life by selecting from available and equally suitable applicants/carers who do not smoke. 
      * The extent of their smoking/the smoking of others within their household and how it is managed within the home.  This should include any arrangements that have been made and family routines, to minimise the risks of passive smoking to other members of the household. 
      * Their intentions or otherwise regarding stopping smoking. If they wish to stop smoking they should be advised of some of the avenues of support available to them including their GP and any local initiatives such as smoking cessation clinics and charities which help people to stop smoking (e.g. "Quit").  Where prospective carers/carers require counselling about their health they should be referred to appropriate health professionals.

Where it appears that a prospective foster carer\'s smoking and the
needs of children to be placed are incompatible it may be appropriate
for a brief foster carer\'s report outlining the issue to be placed
before a Fostering Panel. If this is the case the Social Worker should
consult with the Line Manager. It may be appropriate to seek the advice
of the Panel\'s Medical Advisor, Legal Advisor or both.

## Placements

Subject to subsequent recommendations of the Fostering Panel and Agency
Decision Maker\'s decisions, staff considering potential matches will
evaluate all relevant factors when considering which placement can meet
a child\'s needs. An assessment of each child\'s individual needs will
form the basis for such consideration. The potential for harm as a
result of exposure to passive smoking will be one of the elements for
consideration.

## Reviews and Changes in Approval

Where approved foster carers are subject to review, the implications of
the Policy should be discussed with those approved carers who smoke or
where another member of the household smokes. The approved carers will
need to understand the significance of the Policy to their approval and
have the opportunity to fully explore those matters outlined in Section
4, Advice to Prospective A Foster Carers. The outcome of the discussion
will inform the report to Review Chair or Fostering Panel as required.
Where they are currently registered to take children aged less than five
years of age the issue should be highlighted within the report for the
Review chair or Fostering Panel.

E-cigarettes ====== =====

Due to the lack of research surrounding e-cigarettes using e-cigarettes
will be classified as smoking. Whilst current research evidence suggests
that the use of electronic cigarettes is effective in helping people to
stop using traditional tobacco cigarettes, there is little to suggest
that it is encouraging smoking the current research evidence provided no
compelling reasons for restricting the use of e-cigarettes. Therefore
foster carers should not be prevented from fostering or applying to
foster because of their use of e-cigarettes. However it is good practice
not to use them in front of children and young people until more
evidence is gained about this role modelling effect of this on the
smoking behaviour of children more generally. The briefing paper
produced by ASH foster care adoption and electronic cigarettes which
give a comprehensive overview of the topic. As the use of e-cigarette is
a recent development we will be reviewing this position in 12 months
time. The links documents can be found below.
