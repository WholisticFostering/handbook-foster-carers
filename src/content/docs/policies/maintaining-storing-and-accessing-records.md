title: Maintaining, Storing and Accessing Records

## - Rights of Access

The provisions for access to personal information or records held by WF
are contained in the Data Protection Act 1998. Under this legislation,
those in respect of whom personal information is held in any form have a
right of access to the information, unless one of the exceptions set out
below applies.

Access to foster carer's assessment records can, with their permission,
be made available to another fostering service if they apply to the new
service to become carers.

## - Exceptions

Exceptions to the right to access are:

      - Where practice would otherwise be prejudiced because access to the information would be likely to result in serious harm to the person requesting the information or some other person.
      - Where the person is incapable of managing his or her affairs (for example where the person is a child) and the information was given in the expectation that it would not be disclosed or is information which the subject of the information expressly indicated should not be disclosed

Access can also be refused if:

      * to disclose the information would involve disclosure of information about someone else without that person’s consent and disclosure cannot be justified without that person’s consent; or
      * where disclosure may prevent the detection or investigation of a crime
      * an identical or similar request has been received from the same person and already been complied with, unless a reasonable interval has elapsed

These exceptions do not permit the total withholding of information but
only those sections of the material covered by the exceptions. The
remainder of the case records should be made available to the service
user.

The exceptions do not apply where disclosure is required by a court
order or is necessary for the purpose of or in connection with any legal
proceedings.

However, a Court may prevent disclosure of information where a person
shows that he or she would be caused serious harm to his physical or
mental health by the disclosure.

## - Offering an Informal Approach

The practice of all WF staff should be to encourage ongoing and open
sharing of information and recording, including providing copies of key
documents.

If a person in receipt of services asks to see a particular document or
wants to have information about a particular aspect of the case, the
Supervising Social Worker should discuss this with them to see whether
the request can be dealt with informally by showing them the relevant
part of the recording or providing copies of relevant documents.

## - Handling Formal Requests for Access

Those making a formal request for access to their records should be
asked to put the request in writing. The receipt of the written request
should be recorded by staff, who must verify the identification of the
person making the request. If he or she is not known personally to those
working at the agency, staff must ask for photographic evidence, either
through a passport or driving licence.

Prior to access being given, all case records held on the person should
be located and collected and the approval of the Fostering Service
Manager should be sought. If approval is not given, this must be
communicated to the person seeking access with an explanation.

Staff should carefully check the case records to ensure they are
complete and maintained, and to ascertain whether any of the material
comes within the exceptions to the rights of access (see Section 2,
Exceptions).

There should be no disclosure of the identity of third parties or other
sources of information, which fall within the second exception (see
Section 2, Exceptions).

Any other information supplied by third parties should not usually be
disclosed without the third party\'s consent. When it is not possible to
obtain consent, discretion may be used to release information where
there is no possibility of serious harm.

An appointment should be made at the earliest opportunity to share the
case record with the person making the request, and he or she should be
asked to bring appropriate proof of identity.

WF Staff should be available to explain the contents of the records, to
answer questions and to help the person understand the information
recorded.

Where the person making the request has specific needs in relation to
language or disability, arrangements must be made to present the
information in a suitable manner and to involve approved interpreters as
needed.

Interpretative and supportive counselling may be advisable in certain
cases using a number of interviews to disclose the information, if the
person concerned is willing to proceed in this manner.

A request for copies of information disclosed must be met.

## - Timescales

Access must be given to disclosable information within 40 days of
receiving the request. This is the maximum time period allowed. The
timescale can only be extended with the agreement of the person
requesting access. Where he or she refuses to agree an extension, access
should be given to all information open to disclosure at that point.

## - Application by Children

Requests from children should be treated in the same way as requests
from adults. A judgement should be made by the staff, in conjunction
with the child's social worker as to whether the child making the
request for access understands the nature of the request. Where
appropriate, a parent should be asked to provide written confirmation
that the child understands the nature of the application.

Children with disabilities have the same rights as others to have access
to information held about them. No assumption should be made about their
level of understanding. This should be assessed on an individual basis
as with all children.

A child of sufficient understanding should be allowed regular access to
information held about him or her, consistent with his or her best
interests. He or she should read or be told what has been recorded
unless it falls within one of the exceptions set out above.

A child should be encouraged to record his or her own observations on
the case record including when there is disagreement about an entry in
the file.

## - Application by Parents

If any member of staff considers that the child does not understand the
nature of the request, the parent may make a request on the child\'s
behalf. However, the request must be in the interests of the child,
rather than the interests of the parent.

If a parent seeks to have access to his or her child\'s records, the
worker dealing with the request must assess whether the child might be
able to request access to the records for him or herself. If this is the
case, the worker should check that it is the child\'s choice for the
parent to see the records on his or her behalf. If it is, the child will
be asked to confirm this in writing and access to the parent can then be
agreed.

Whether or not a child is capable of understanding the request or has
consented to the parent making the request, it is important that a
parent should only be given access to

the information about the child if the worker in consultation with his
or her manager is satisfied that the request is made in the child\'s and
not the parent\'s interest.

## - Application by Agents

A request for access to records may be made through an agent (for
example, a solicitor).

It is the agent\'s responsibility to produce satisfactory evidence that
he or she has authority to have access to the records. This will always
include proof of their identity.

The Fostering Service Manager will decide whether the representative
will be allowed access, having sought legal advice if necessary.

## - Application on Behalf of Deceased Persons

Where a request is received for access to the records of some-one who
has died, the person making the application should be asked to explain
in writing their relationship to the deceased person, what information
is needed and why. The staff should make a decision in consultation with
his or her manager and advise the applicant in writing of the decision
with reasons.

## - Corrections or Erasure of Records

If a person considers that any part of the information held on his or
her records is inaccurate, he or she has the right to apply in writing
for it to be corrected or erased.

If the objection is justified, there is a duty to correct or erase the
appropriate information.

## - Refusal of Access

If staff consider there are reasons to refuse a request for access to
all or any part of the records (see Section 2, Exceptions), this should
be discussed with his or her manager and legal advice should be
obtained.

The Fostering Service Manager should be asked to make a final decision
on refusal of access, having sought legal advice if required. If
refused, the date of the request and reason for refusal must be recorded
in the file.

The decision and the reasons for it should be confirmed in writing to
the person requesting access, or in a format appropriate to the needs of
the person concerned.

## - Appeals Process

The person concerned has the right to apply to the Court for an order to
disclose, correct or erase information held. They also have a right of
appeal to the Data Protection Commissioner.
