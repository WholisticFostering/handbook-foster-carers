**This policy aims to safeguard children, young people, foster carers
and staff in the responsible and secure use of internet and email.**

## 📲 Internet Access and Associated Risks

Access to the internet can occur in many settings:

-   School
-   Mobile phones
-   Home computers
-   Handheld devices
-   Clubs and libraries

While online access is essential for modern life --- including
education, jobs and communication --- it carries serious risks,
especially for children and young people:

-   **Pornographic content** -- Explicit adult or illegal images are
    often easy to access
-   **Chat rooms** -- Anonymous communication may lead to grooming or
    exploitation
-   **Illegal downloads** -- Sharing music/movies can result in fines or
    legal consequences
-   **Online scams** -- Websites and apps can extract money fraudulently
-   **Cyberbullying** -- Threatening emails, texts or messages can
    severely affect mental health
-   **Happy slapping** -- Filming assaults and sharing them is a
    criminal offence
-   **Oversharing personal info** -- E.g. on Facebook, may lead to
    safeguarding breaches or contact with birth family inappropriately

## 🔐 How to Reduce Risks

-   Always **supervise children** when online
-   Keep computers in **common areas** -- avoid access in bedrooms
-   Use **parental control software** -- many ISPs offer free filtering
    tools
-   **Warn children** not to give out personal details online
-   Discourage use of **chat rooms** entirely
-   Instruct children **not to open unknown emails** -- risk of viruses
    or data theft
-   **Limit screen time** to prevent eye strain and isolation

Wholistic Fostering offers **CEOP 'Think U Know' sessions** for ages
11--16, covering:

-   Cyberbullying
-   Sexting
-   Grooming

Adult training is also available for carers and staff.

## 🚨 If You Have Concerns

If you suspect risky internet behaviour or harm:

-   Contact your **Supervising Social Worker (SSW)** immediately
-   In urgent safeguarding cases, the **Child Protection Procedure**
    should be followed
-   If internet misuse occurs at **school or another organisation**,
    inform a representative (e.g. teacher)
