title: Internet & Email Policy
---


      * Access to the internet can be gained by a number of means and places e.g. at school, via mobile phones, home computers, handheld devices, clubs etc. Computers are a part of modern life and it is vital that young people have access to them and learn how to use them appropriately. They can be a great tool for helping with research or homework, in looking for jobs and colleges. However the internet does contain a number of risks, some of which are listed below.
      * Pornographic material – it is widely known that security systems are minimal to gain access to explicit adult material and there are many web sites containing illegal images.
      * Chat rooms – These are forums were people can chat on line using text type messages. It is widely known, through the press and media, that many people lie about their age and identity in chat rooms and some adults who wish to harm young people use chat rooms as a way of gaining access to children and abductions.
      * Illegal downloads and file sharing – lots of people download music and films and share these on line or by using mobile phones. However, this can result in a £2,000 fine through copyright laws.
      * Financial manipulation – there are sites set up explicitly to extort money out of people, where ‘money’ can be spent and added to mobile phone bills (even from normal computers) and recently there have been an explosion of poker websites. There are many other sites like these designed to extract money.
      * Bullying – children have been bullied through threatening emails and texts messages
      * Happy slapping – highlighted in the media, some people assault others and film it on their phones to share with others. Your child could either be a perpetrator or victim of this. The matter is treated as assault by the police and if found guilty perpetrators are liable for convictions.
      * Personal information – sites such as Facebook allow a great deal of personal information to be published both by the young people themselves and by carers and their households. This can lead to risks and vulnerability e.g. family member being able to communicate with young people who have no contact orders. Carers need to be aware of what information and pictures are being displayed.

## How to Reduce Risks

Clearly the best way to reduce a risk is to remove it altogether.
However, this is not practical in the modern world. Our best
recommendation is that when young people are using the internet or
computers they should be supervised. Household computers should be
situated in open places where their use can be monitored. We strongly
advise against allowing any child to have a computer with internet
access in their bedrooms.

Most internet Service Providers (ISPs) have free tools or programmes to
block inappropriate web sites. However, these are not 'fail safe' and
young people can learn to disable these or work around them.

If the young people you look after have access to the Net, you should be
warning them about the risks and especially about not giving away
personal information or details. It would be good to get them to avoid
chat rooms all together.

You should advise children and young people not to open email unless
they know the person who has sent them. There are a great deal of
unsolicited e mails out there that contain viruses which can destroy
your computer or 'Trojan horses' which send your personal details out to
people for fraudulent use.

It is also good practice to limit the time that a young person spends on
the computer. Prolonged periods in front of a PC can cause eye damage
and does not help promote a child's social skills or health.

Wholistic Fostering is able offer CEOP Think U Know sessions for 11-16
year olds which covers Cyber bullying; Sexting and Grooming. There is
also an adult presentation, which is offered to our foster carers and
staff.

## Concerns

If you have any concerns over the way the young person accesses the Net
or uses it you should seek advice and guidance from your SSW
immediately. Guidance can also be obtained from the CEOP website listed
below.

Issues linked to the internet can quickly and easily escalate and
warrant consideration of using the child protection procedure. If
concerned that a young person may be at risk of harm, access to the Net
must be stopped immediately and consult with your SSW.

If the concerns arise from use of a computer elsewhere such as a school
you must share your concerns with a representative of that organisation
e.g. a teacher.

## Internet Policy for Staff - Safety & Usage Guidelines

Wholistic Fostering is aware that the nature of the Internet is that of
a global network which may transmit information from countries that have
different beliefs and laws to

the United Kingdom. It is possible for staff to be exposed (or expose
others) to material that may be considered offensive and /or illegal in
this country. It is the staff member's responsibility to prevent this
while using Wholistic Fostering's Internet facilities. To help staff
fulfil this obligation Wholistic Fostering has provided some Safety and
Usage Guidelines.

The following guidelines have been written to help staff to comply with
this policy. All equipment and other users should be treated with
respect and facilities should be used in a way that does not disrupt its
use by others. Staff should be aware that despite the virtual nature of
communication, use of the Internet can entail personal risk. The
following guidelines are suggested to ensure a safer and more productive
experience when using Wholistic Fostering's Internet facilities.

      - Staff should be aware that Internet access is monitored for network management purposes and that every site visited is recorded.
      - Individual email messages are backed up and can be restored at a later time. This provides Wholistic Fostering with the tools monitor the email usage. However Wholistic Fostering does not undertake random surveillance.
      - Sometimes the Internet can seem separate from real life – it’s not. Laws and standards of behaviour do apply.
      - Staff should not give personal details such as home address, telephone numbers or other contact details via the Internet, particularly if the recipients are unknown.
      - Never give out log–in information or passwords. It is possible for someone to access ALL your information should you do so. Any activity related to your logon information will be attributed to you.
      - Do not reply to offensive or threatening messages via the Internet, keep a copy of the message and inform any member of the IT Department.
      - Emails have the same legal status as written documents. Staff should ask themselves, before sending an email, how they would feel if their message was read out in court. Email messages may be disclosed in litigation
      - Staff should obtain confirmation receipt for important emails sent.
      - Staff should reply promptly to all email messages requiring a reply. Where a prompt detailed response is not possible, then send a short acknowledging receipt and give an estimate of when a detailed response will be sent.
      - If staff discover any material they consider may be offensive or inappropriate they should report the matter immediately to our IT Department.
      - The downloading and attempted installation of software is strictly prohibited.

### Personal Use

      * Although the internet and email facilities are for the purpose of conducting business an occasional and reasonable amount of personal use is expectable.
      * Personal usage of the facilities should be avoided wherever possible during normal working hours (usage should normally only be during lunch brakes).
      * Personal usage is carried out at staWF own risk
      * The Internet and Email rules and Code of Practice applies at all times.
