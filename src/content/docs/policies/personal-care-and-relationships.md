## 📘 Scope

This policy follows the Fostering Services National Minimum Standards
(2011), Standard 6 -- Promoting Health and Wellbeing.

## 🤝 Physical Contact

Carers should show warmth and care through safe and respectful physical
contact. This must never be sexualised or reinforce gender stereotypes.
Play should be inclusive, but not involve play-fighting or physical
contests.

## 🚿 Intimate Care

Children are encouraged to care for themselves, with support as needed.
Any intimate care must protect the child's dignity and usually be
carried out by an adult of the same gender. Specialist training is
available where necessary.

## 🛏️ Bedrooms

Children aged 3 and over must have their own bedroom, unless sharing is
risk-assessed and agreed. Bedrooms should reflect the child's
personality and be clean, safe, and private. Carers must knock before
entering, unless there\'s a safety concern.

## 🌱 Growing Up and Identity

Carers should support children through puberty, body changes, and
questions about sexuality or gender identity. Children must receive
accurate information and respectful, non-judgemental support.

## 📵 Pornography

Children must not access illegal or harmful content. Legal adult content
must be kept private. Any concerns, including access to extreme
material, should be shared with the child's social worker and the
Fostering Manager.

## 💑 Sexual Activity

Children under 13 cannot legally consent to sex and must be safeguarded.
For older children, carers should monitor relationships and support
children in staying safe. Concerns should be discussed with the
Supervising Social Worker and, if needed, child protection agencies.

## 🍼 Contraception & Pregnancy

Contraceptive advice should be accessible without judgement. If a child
becomes pregnant, carers must inform the Supervising Social Worker who
will work with the child's social worker to support the child
appropriately.

## 💔 Sexual Exploitation

Any suspected exploitation must be reported immediately. Carers and
staff must build trust and help children move away from risky or
exploitative situations. Concerns must be reflected in the child's
Placement Plan and shared with safeguarding agencies.

## 🦠 Sexual Health

If a child may have a sexually transmitted infection, this must be
reported to the Supervising Social Worker and child's social worker.

## 👦🏽 Peer-on-Peer Abuse

Normal curiosity should not be confused with abusive behaviour. Any
coercive, harmful, or inappropriate behaviour must be reported and
addressed through safeguarding procedures.

## 🩸 Menstruation

Girls should have easy access to sanitary products and be supported with
privacy and dignity.

## 🚽 Enuresis and Encopresis

Issues like bedwetting should be handled with sensitivity. Children
should never be punished. Support should include privacy, cleaning help,
and recording incidents if needed.

## 📋 The Use of Touch

Appropriate touch can reassure and comfort. Carers should:

-   Respect personal boundaries
-   Understand each child's history and preferences
-   Avoid intimate areas
-   Be transparent and record any concerns

Touch should never be secretive, sexualised, or make a child feel
uncomfortable.

## 🗣️ Language and Communication

Carers must avoid abusive or demeaning language. All communication
should be respectful and constructive.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Building Relationships

Carers should develop warm, trusting bonds with children while
maintaining safe boundaries. If relationships raise concern, carers must
speak with their Supervising Social Worker.

## ✅ Summary

All children have the right to safety, respect, and support in their
personal care and relationships. Carers should work in partnership with
social workers, always placing the child's wellbeing at the centre of
care.
