title: Personal Care and Relationships
---


## Scope

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 6, Promoting Health and
Wellbeing.

## Physical Contact

Carers must provide a level of care, including physical contact, which
is designed to demonstrate warmth, friendliness and positive regard for
children.

Physical contact should be given in a manner which is safe, protective
and avoids the arousal of sexual expectations, feelings or in any way
which reinforces sexual stereotypes.

Whilst carers are actively encouraged to play with children, it is not
acceptable to play fight or participate in overtly physical games or
tests of strength with the children.

## Intimate Care

Children must be supported and encouraged to undertake bathing, showers
and other intimate care of themselves without relying on carers.

Such arrangements must emphasise that children\'s dignity and their
right to be consulted and involved will be protected and promoted; and,
where necessary, carers will be provided with specialist training and
support.

Unless otherwise agreed, children will be given intimate care by adults
of the same gender.

## Bedrooms

Each child over 3 will have their own bedroom or, where this is not
possible, the sharing of the bedroom will have been agreed by the
Placing Authority, and the Supervising Social Worker must have conducted
a risk assessment and any arrangements must be outlined in the child's
Placement Arrangement/Placement Plan.

Children should be encouraged to personalise their bedrooms, with
posters, pictures and personal items of their choice.

Children of an appropriate age and level of understanding should be
encouraged and supported to purchase furniture, equipment or
decorations. For older children this should be part of a plan to prepare
the child for independence.

Children\'s room should be kept in good structural repair and be clean
and tidy. The furniture should conform to standards of flame retardant
materials as advised by Trading Standards.

Where a child\'s bedroom window is large enough for a child to climb out
of, a risk assessment should be carried out as to the likelihood of the
child putting themselves at risk by climbing out of the window. If a
risk is identified, the Supervising Social Worker should consider
strategies to reduce/prevent the risk, which should be outlined in the
child\'s Placement Agreement/Placement Plan. It is however, part of WF's
Health and Safety procedures that all windows have locks that are in
working order, with the necessary keys available to the carer in order
to provide periods of ventilation.

Children\'s privacy should be respected. Unless there are exceptional
circumstances, Carers should knock the door before entering children\'s
bedrooms; and then only enter with their permission.

The exceptional circumstances where carers may have to enter a child\'s
bedroom without asking permission include:

      * To wake a heavy sleeper, undertake cleaning, return clean or remove soiled clothing; though, in these circumstances, the child should have been told/warned that this may be necessary. 
      * To take necessary action, including forcing entry, to protect the child or others from injury or to prevent likely damage to property. The taking of such action is a form of Physical Intervention and must be recorded in the cares daily log. 

## Puberty and Sexual Identity

Carers must adopt a non-judgemental attitude toward children,
particularly as they mature and develop an awareness of their bodies and
sexuality.

Carers must adopt the same approach to children who explore or are
confused about their sexual identity or who have decided to embrace a
particular lifestyle so long as it is not abusive or illegal.

Children who are confused about their sexual identity or indicate they
have a preference must be afforded equal access to accurate information,
education and support to enable them to move forward positively.

As necessary this must be addressed in each child's Placement
Arrangement/Placement plan

## Pornography

All materials published, circulated or available to children (including
the internet) must promote and encourage healthy lifestyles and images
of men and women that are positive and encouraging.

Children must be positively discouraged from obtaining material that is
potentially offensive or pornographic.

If they obtain such material that is suspected to be illegal it must be
confiscated. This should be discussed with the child's social worker and
if there are concerns that the child has been exposed to extreme
pornography, the concerns should be shared with the Fostering Manager

If children obtain material legally they should be required to keep it
private.

## Sexual Activity in Homes

Children under the age of 13 are deemed to be incapable of giving
consent to sexual activity. Therefore, children of this age who engage
in sexual activity must be referred to the local authority's Children's
Social Care Services under the Local Safeguarding Children Board's Inter
Agency Safeguarding Procedures (as a Child Protection Referral) as
potentially suffering from Significant Harm.

WF must be alert to such relationships when considering the placement of
children under 13. Children of this age who are likely to be at risk
from each other (or from older children) should not be placed together.

When considering the placement (or ongoing placement) of children over
the age of 13, the risk of sexual relationships developing must be
assessed and strategies put in place to reduce or prevent risk if they
are likely to be exploitative or abusive.

Where children aged 13 - 18 are placed together with no identified risk
of exploitative or abusive behaviour, carers must monitor any developing
relationships, sensitively but positively discouraging children from
engaging in under aged sexual relationships.

Overall, carers should be mindful of their duty to consider the overall
welfare of children and this may mean recognising that illegal activity
is taking place and working to minimise risks and consequences. If there
is any suspicion that a child is engaging in illegal behaviour it must
be discussed with the Supervising Social Worker, who should consult the
child's social worker and consideration should be given to consulting
the Child Protection Agencies. The fostering agency must be alert to the
possibility that the child may be being sexually exploited and if there
are concerns of this nature, the Fostering Manager should be informed
(see **Section 8, [Sexual Exploitation](Sexual Exploitation)** below).

Any actions taken in this respect will be subject to consultation and
must be addressed in Placement Agreements/Placement Plans.

Should foster carers suspect children are engaging in sexual
relationships, they should:

      - Ensure the basic safety of all the children concerned. 
      - Inform the Supervising Social Worker, who should notify/consult relevant social workers.

## Contraception and Pregnancy

Access to contraceptives will not be conditional on children giving
information about their lifestyles and contraception will never be
withdrawn as a punitive measure.

Whilst not encouraging it, it is understood that children may engage in
sexual activity; some before they reach the age of consent. In such
circumstances the Supervising Social Worker should consult the child's
social worker to agree what reasonable steps can be taken to minimise
risk of pregnancy or infection, including facilitating contact with
relevant agencies providing contraceptive advice.

If a child is suspected or known to be pregnant the carers should notify
the Supervising Social Worker, who should consult the child's social
worker to decide on the actions that should be taken.

## Sexual Exploitation

Children may have previously exchanged sex for rewards, gifts, drugs,
accommodation and money. Some maintain this lifestyle whilst continuing
to be accommodated by the authority. Such situations must be reported to
the fostering Manager

The Supervising Social Worker and carers must be alert to such
behaviours and should do all they can to create an environment which
encourages children to be open about their past or present attitudes and
behaviours and which demonstrates they will be supported to guide them
away from such lifestyles.

Where there is any suspicion that a child is engaged in such behaviour
it should be addressed in the child\'s Placement Arrangement/Placement
Plan together with strategies to be adopted to help the child find
alternative lifestyles.

In addressing these behaviours consideration must be given to the extent
to which the child is suffering Significant Harm - and whether it is
necessary to refer the child to the local authority's Children's Social
Care Services in the area where the child is living under the Local
Safeguarding Children Board's Inter Agency Safeguarding Procedures.

If there is any suspicion that a child is involved in prostitution, the
Regulatory Authority must be notified.

## Sexually Transmitted Diseases

If it is known or suspected that a child has a sexually transmitted
disease (including HIV and AIDS), the Supervising Social Worker and
child's social worker must be informed so that they can decide what
measures to take.

## Peer Group Abuse

See also **Countering Bullying Procedure**.

The possibility of peer abuse will always be taken seriously but we
recognise it is equally important not to label or stigmatise normal
sexual exploration and experimentation between children.

Behaviour is not a cause for concern unless it is compulsive, coercive,
ageinappropriate or between children of significantly different ages,
maturity or mental abilities.

If at any time carers suspect children are engaged in abusive sexual
relationships as perpetrators and/or victims, they must immediately
inform the Supervising Social Worker, who must consult the social worker
and make a referral to the local authority's Children's Social Care
Services in the area where the child is living under the Local
Safeguarding Children Board's Inter Agency Safeguarding Procedures.

## Menstruation

Young women should be supported and encouraged to keep their own supply
of sanitary protection without having to request it from carers.

There should also be adequate provision for the private disposal of used
sanitary protection.

## Enuresis and Encopresis

If it is known or suspected that a child is likely to experience
enuresis, encopresis or may be prone to smearing it should be discussed
openly, with the child if possible, and strategies adopted for managing
it; these strategies should be outlined in the child\'s Placement
Agreement/Placement Plan.

Foster carers and Supervising Social Workers, together with the social
workers for the children concerned should consider the possible reasons
for enuresis and encopresis. There may be a variety of reasons but it is
likely that such behaviour is symptomatic of anxiety and worries about
previous experiences including abuse and neglect.

It may be appropriate to consult a Continence Nurse or other specialist,
who may advise on the most appropriate strategy to adopt. In the absence
of such advice, the following should be adopted:

      * Talk to the child in private, openly but sympathetically. 
      * Do not treat it as the fault of the child, or apply any form of sanction. 
      * Do not require the child to clear up; arrange for the child to be cleaned and remove then wash any soiled bedding and clothes. 
      * Keep a record, either on a dedicated form or in the child’s Daily Record with detail, if necessary, in a Detailed Record. 
      * Consider making arrangements for the child to have any supper in good time before retiring, and arranging for the child to use the toilet before retiring; also consider arranging for the child to be woken to use the toilet during the night. 
      * Use mattresses or bedding that can withstand being soiled or wetted.  

## Guidance in Relation to Personal Care and Relationships and the Use of Touch

The term \'Touch\' is used throughout these procedures in two different
contexts.

\'Touch\' as a form of physical intervention designed to prevent a child
or others from being injured or to protect property from being damaged;
and the use of \'Touch\' to enable carers to demonstrate affection,
acceptance and reassurance.

This section provides guidance relating to the demonstration of
affection, acceptance and reassurance.

It is acknowledged that touch raises particular issues for those working
with children. Some people have views about applying a \"hands off\" or
\"hands on\" policy with children result from scandals of child abuse,
or fear of violence from children. Carers may be anxious about
allegations of inappropriate physical contact with children.

However, touch is acceptable; but carers should consider the following:

The child may have had particular experiences which make it difficult to
accept touch from an adult; or the child\'s experiences may lead to a
need for more touch than is acceptable.

It is therefore important for carers to obtain information about the
child\'s background before acting in any way, not just in terms of the
use of touch.

If there are particular needs that the child has or if it appears that
the child may respond more or less favourably to touch, this must be
shared with the foster carers during the placement planning process.

Dependent on the age and level of understanding of the child, s/he
should be involved in this assessment and planning; and should be
encouraged to consent to being touched; or to place conditions on it.

The culture or values of the household should be such that touch is
encouraged; as a positive and safe way of communicating affection,
warmth, acceptance and reassurance.

Carers and children should be encouraged to use touch, positively and
safely. But it is important for carers and children to know if
boundaries exist for individual children within the foster home.

If boundaries or expectations exist for individual children, they should
be set out clearly in their Placement Agreement/Placement Plan, for
example, if carers are not expected to allow children to sit on their
laps, or to carry children, this should be stated in writing.

In the absence of any plan or expectation, the following should be
taking into consideration

      * When thinking about who is an appropriate person to touch a child, it is vital to consider what the adult represents to the particular child. Personal likes and dislikes will play a part in any relationship. 
      * In addition, many factors influence the power relationship between adult and child, including gender, race, disability, age, sexual identity and role status. 
      * The background of the child will also influence any decision about who represents a 'safe' adult in the eyes of the child. 
      * Children from ethnic minority backgrounds may be used to different types of touch as part of the culture. 
      * Children who have been subject to physical or sexual abuse may be suspicious or fearful of touch. This is not to say that children who have experienced abuse should not be touched, it may be beneficial for the child to know different, safer and more reliable adults who will not use touch as a form of abuse. 
      * For each child, what constitutes an intimate part of the body will vary; but generally speaking it is acceptable to touch children's hands, arms, shoulders. It may be appropriate to hug or cuddle children, or carry or give them 'piggy backs'. 
      * Other parts of the body are less appropriate to be touched, by degrees. Some parts of the body are 'no go areas'. 
      * Therefore, it may be appropriate to touch a child's back, ears or stroke their hair or knees - if the child indicates such touch is acceptable. To go beyond this would be unacceptable, even if the child appeared to accept it. 
      * In any case, no part of the body should be touched if it were likely to generate sexualised feelings on the part of the adult or child. 
      * Also, no part of the body should be touched in a way which appeared patronising or otherwise intrusive. 
      * Therefore, the context in which touch takes place is usually a decisive factor in determining the emotional and physical safety for both parties. 
      * What message is being sent out to the child? If the intention is to positively and safely communicate affection, warmth, acceptance and reassurance it is likely to be acceptable. 
      * A fleeting or clumsy touch may confuse a child or may feel uncomfortable or even cause distress. Carers should touch with confidence, and should verbalise their affection, reassurance and acceptance; by touching and making positive comments, for example, by touching a child's arm and saying "Well Done". 
      * Where children indicate that touch is unwelcome carers should back off and apologise if necessary. 
      * Carers should talk to colleagues and record their interactions with children. If particular strategies work, or not, colleagues should be informed so they can build on or avoid making the same mistake. 
      * Touch of an equally positive and safe nature is acceptable between carers; demonstrating positive role models for children and showing that adults can get along and use touch in non-abusive or non- threatening ways. 
      * It is also acceptable to talk with children about how touch feels, about acceptable boundaries and expectations. 
      * Play fighting is no alternative for this. It is unacceptable. 
      * The key is for carers to help children experience and benefit from touch,          positively and safely; as a way of communicating affection, warmth,         acceptance and reassurance. 

## Appropriate Language

It is essential that all carers are aware that the use of foul and
abusive language directed towards children is totally inappropriate and
unnecessary. This will only have the effect of demeaning children, have
a negative effect on the child/carer relationship and lead to an
escalation of disruptive and challenging behaviour.

All carers and Staff need to be aware that any complaints relating to
foul and abusive language will be treated seriously and may lead to
disciplinary measures.

## Friendship and Support

Confidence in and promoting a good rapport for a child with particular
adults is a fundamental element in good care practices. Whilst children
are in foster care a variety of problems will arise, and at times of
stress or crisis every child needs an adult to turn to.

One of the prime tasks for foster carers is to work with the children to
maximise opportunities for forming and benefiting from such
relationships with adults.

Warmth and understanding are essential, but everyone needs to know and
understand when a relationship is inappropriate. What is important is
that carers need to be putting the children\'s interests first and
always considering what is appropriate in any given situation with a
particular child.

Where it is known that a child has been a victim of sexual abuse and it
is likely he or she will behave towards carers in a sexual manner,
particular rules will have to be drawn up for carers. This may involve
the need to avoid being alone with the child, by always having a third
person present.

Children who have suffered many unexpected losses in adult relationships
are likely to be constantly fearful of being abandoned again.

Carers must have knowledge and understanding of the child and his or her
background, and be able to recognise and respect any emotional barriers
the child has erected.

Carers should be sufficiently aware of their own feelings, so that they
can recognise the dangers of a relationship with a child becoming
sexualised and stop to consider what is happening and what they are
doing.

Other people's feelings and views, both adults and children, need to be
taken into account. If there is any indication that a relationship is
viewed as inappropriate, the foster carers should discuss the matter
with each other and their Supervising Social Worker in order to
understand what the concerns may be, explain their own perspectives and
consider how they should modify their behaviour to ensure they are
acting in the child's best interests.

In general, if they feel in any doubt about their own or other people\'s
feelings, foster carers should step back, consider what they are doing
and discuss the issues with their colleagues.

It is not a matter of carers never becoming involved in close one to one
relationships with a child, it is a vital part of the \'caring\' task,
however, carers must be aware of the dangers that this type of work can
bring and be clear where the boundaries in such relationships lie.
