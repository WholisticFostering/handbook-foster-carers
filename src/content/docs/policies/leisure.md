## Underpinning Regulations and Standards

The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 place specific
requirements upon fostering services in relation to education,
employment and leisure activities in regulation 16. Specifically, in
relation to leisure activities:

• To ensure that foster carers promote the leisure interests of children
and young people. National Minimum Standard 7 identifies that children
should be able to enjoy interests, develop confidence in their skills
and be encouraged to engage in leisure activities. Foster children
should live in a stimulating environment and be supported to take part
in school based and out of school activities. Foster carers should be
supported to make reasonable and appropriate day-to-day decisions within
the authority delegated to them, without having to seek consent
unnecessarily:

\<WRAP center round info 60%\> 'Children have permission to take part in
age appropriate peer activities as would normally be granted by a
reasonable parent to their children, within the framework of the
placement plan. Decision-making and any assessment of risk to the child
should be undertaken on the same basis as a reasonable parent would do'.
(Standard 7.5) \</WRAP\>

This includes overnight stays, holidays with friends, or friends and
relatives of their foster carer, school trips and so on, subject to any
restrictions in the care or placement plan. CRB checks should not
normally be sought as a precaution and there is no requirement that
foster carer's friends or relatives be approved as foster carers if the
child remains formally placed with their usual foster carer/s (The
Children Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations Volume 4: Fostering Services
paragraphs 3.22-3.23).

## Ensuring that foster carers support and promote leisure interests

We ensure that foster carers promote the leisure interests of children
and young people through making reviews a part of supervision.
