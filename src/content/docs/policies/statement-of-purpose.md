Wholistic Fostering compiles a Statement of Purpose, which sets out the
aims and objectives of the service as a whole, and the services and
facilities which are provided, including the provision of any parent and
child arrangements.

1.  Our SOP sets a framework for all of the business of the fostering
    service (The Children Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations Volume 4).
2.  It is consistent with relevant legislation, Regulations, NMS and
    statutory guidance (paragraph 4.2).
3.  At all times our service aims to be conducted in a manner which is
    consistent with the statement of purpose (regulation 3(5)).
4.  We do not offer provision for family and friends foster carers and
    as such the are not included in the list of services
5.  The statement must be reviewed and updated as necessary, but at
    least annually, and published on the provider's website (if they
    have one) with a copy provided to Ofsted.
6.  Copies are made available upon request to anyone working for the
    purposes of Wholistic Fostering, any foster carer or potential
    foster carer of the service, and to any child placed with one of the
    service's foster carers and their parents or persons with parental
    responsibility.
7.  The aims and objectives are 'child focused and show how our service
    will meet outcomes for children'. (National Minimum Standard 16)
