decision if needed.

## 📝 Applying to Foster

Applicants complete:

-   An application form
-   Consent for health checks, references & background checks
-   A written declaration that the information is true

They are then booked onto the next available **Skills to Foster**
course.

## 🎓 Tools to Foster Training

Pre-approval training program - equivalent to skills to foster

All applicants attend this course to:

-   Reflect on their suitability
-   Allow our team to observe their strengths

Attendance and participation form part of the overall assessment. If
concerns arise, applicants may be advised not to continue. They have a
right to challenge this decision through Panel.

to:

-   Employment references
-   Personal references (including a family member)
-   Ex-partner checks where relevant

Health checks via GP are reviewed by our Medical Adviser.

A qualified social worker undertakes the assessment using **BAAF Form
F**. The assessment explores:

-   Parenting and life experience
-   Ability to provide a safe, nurturing home

-   Understanding of safeguarding and behaviour

Family members are also interviewed. Accommodation is reviewed and
safety-checked.

Assessment includes observations from:

The final report includes:

-   Suggested approval terms (age range, number of children, etc)

Applicants have 28 days to comment before the report goes to Panel.

## 🧑‍⚖️ The Fostering Panel

Applicants are invited to attend Panel, where:

-   The full report and checks are reviewed
-   Social workers present their assessment
-   Applicants can respond to the Panel's questions

Panel makes a **recommendation** to our Agency Decision Maker (ADM), who
confirms the final decision.

Applicants are told the outcome verbally within 24 hours, and receive
written confirmation within 5 working days.

## 🛑 What if the Application is Refused?

If the ADM intends to refuse, the applicant receives:

-   A written notice with reasons
