title: Recruitment, Assessment and Approval of Foster Parents
---


## - Scope

This chapter explains the way in which people are dealt with from their
initial enquiry, to the consideration of their assessment at the
Fostering Panel. It should be read in conjunction with the following
procedures:

      * [[:policies:exemptions_and_extensions|Exemptions and Extensions Procedure]]
      * [[:policies:persons_disqualified_from_fostering_procedure|Persons Disqualified from Fostering Procedure]]

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 13 Recruiting and Assessing
Foster Parents.

## - Responding to Requests for Information

Throughout the process of enquiry and assessment, potential parents will
be treated with respect and fairness. They will be dealt with by members
of staff that are able to pass on relevant information and have the
skills to deal with them. They will be kept informed of the progress of
their application and assessment, which will be presented to the
Fostering Panel in a maximum of eight months from the receipt of their
application.

On receipt of an enquiry from a potential foster parent, an
administrative officer will record the enquirer\'s details which must
include:

      * Full name, date of birth, address and telephone number
      * Date of request
      * Marital status
      * Names of other members in household and their ages
      * The applicants availability to foster
      * Details of the accommodation, including available bedrooms for foster children
      * Previous experience and details of any other approvals already given
      * Type of fostering sought (respite, short-term, long-term, number of children etc)

Within 5 working days of any enquiry, the Fostering Service will provide
the enquirer with an information pack containing information about
fostering and the assessment process.

If deemed appropriate at the time of the enquiry WF will offer the
enquirer an initial visit to take place at a time that is convenient for
the enquirer and the agency.

The information pack will also include an application form which
enquirers are asked to complete and return if they wish to pursue their
interest.

In cases where the application form is completed and returned this will
be reviewed by a fostering manager.

If assessed as appropriate the fostering manager will arrange an initial
home visit to the enquirers if this has not already taken place

## - Initial Visit to Enquirers and Application

The fostering manager will arrange for a worker to meet the enquirer in
their own home. The allocated social worker will contact the enquirer
within 5 working days of the allocation and make arrangements to
undertake the initial visit.

The purpose of the initial visit is to give further information to the
potential applicants about the tasks expected of foster parents and the
skills, experience, knowledge and aptitudes necessary for fostering, as
well as to describe the assessment and approval process. The social
worker will also discuss any relevant health, criminal, accommodation,
employment and financial issues with the potential applicants, and
consider with them the next steps and whether it may be appropriate to
move forward with their application.

A second visit may be required for some potential applicants to cover
areas not explored at the first visit or to explore further any areas of
concern highlighted during the Initial Visit. Potential applicants will
be advised not to pursue their interest where they have recently faced
significant challenges within their family, such as newly formed
partnerships or reconstituted families, serious illness, pregnancy,
separation or bereavement.

Potential applicants may also be advised not to pursue an application at
this stage where it is considered that the application would be
inappropriate having regard to information obtained at the initial
visit.

Potential applicants should be asked whether they have either fostered
or applied to foster before and if so which agencies they applied to or
were approved by. If they are still the subject of an approval they
cannot be considered until that approval is terminated.

The social worker will make a recommendation about whether the enquirer
should make a formal application and discuss their recommendation with
their manager, who will make a decision whether it would be appropriate
to invite an application. The outcome of the visit and the manager's
decision will be recorded.

If there are reasons for not inviting an application, the manager will
write to the enquirers setting out the decision not to proceed and the
reasons. Advice should be given on the steps they may take if they
disagree with the decision. This will include information about the
Complaints Procedure.

Where there is agreement from the fostering manager to invite an
application, the enquirer/s will be asked to complete an application
form,(if not already done) together with the Criminal Records Bureau
forms for all members of the household aged 18 and over and frequent
visitors aged 18 and over. Applicants will also be asked to participate
with medical checks (see **Section,
[Health](/procedures/assessment_and_approval_of_foster_parents)**),
other agency checks (see **Section, Checks**) and they will need to
provide the names of at least three personal referees (see **Section,
References**).

They are also required to enter into a written agreement with the agency
stating that the information that they have provided is true and that
they are aware that their failure to comply with this agreement will
lead to the refusal of their application.

The name of the applicant/s will then be placed on the list for the next
'Skills to Foster' Training Course.

The fostering manager will allocate the prospective applicant to a
social worker to undertake the full assessment of the application - see
**Section, Home Study/Assessment**).

## - Skills to Foster Training Course

Following receipt of their application form, the applicants will be
invited to attend the \'Skills to Foster\' Training Course.

Skills to Foster Training Courses will usually be planned to enable
applicants to have at least 4 weeks\' notice of their date and venue so
as to encourage extensive participation.

The attendance of and the contribution to the Skills to Foster Training
Course will form part the assessment of the applicant\'s suitability to
become foster parent/s.

Skills to Foster Training Courses provide an opportunity for the
assessing social workers to find out more about the applicants and have
a clearer idea of their strengths, areas for further work and any
concerns that need to be clarified as part of the assessment process.

The Skills to Foster Training Courses are also aimed at self-assessment
in that they enable applicants to find out more about fostering and help
them discover whether fostering is right for them and their family.

The facilitators of the Group will complete a record of observations
made of the applicants, that will be shared with them and the assessing
social worker as part of the assessment and this will also form part of
the report presented to the Fostering Panel.

Applicants are expected to attend all the Skills to Foster Training
Courses offered. In the case of joint applications, both must attend.

If the application is not deemed appropriate because of information
emerging from the Groups, for example where there are child protection
concerns in relation to the family or the family\'s values, the
applicant will be informed in writing of this decision, with reasons.

Where the applicant disagrees with the decision and/or is not willing to
withdraw, a brief report on the application should be presented to the
Fostering Panel and the procedure to be followed should be the same as
if the report was a full report on the applicants (see \*\*Section, The
Panel Recommendation \*\* to **Section, Representations / Independent
Review Procedure**).

## - Checks

The applicants and all people aged 18 or over living or regularly
visiting the household will be asked to complete the Criminal Records
Bureau (CRB) disclosure forms and produce the necessary identification.
These will then be sent to the Criminal Records Bureau by the fostering
service.

(Note: CRB checks are not transferable so copies of checks taken by
other agencies or for other posts cannot be accepted.)

Administrative staff within the fostering service will also carry out
checks by writing to the NSPCC, relevant Health Trust, Education
Service, Schools (in relation to the applicant\'s own children) and
Children\'s Social Care Services for the area where the applicants live
and (if appropriate) where the applicants previously lived, including
asking for a check to be made as to whether any of the applicant's
children have been subject to a Child Protection Plan.

Where applicants have moved to the UK within the last 10 years, checks
will also be made through the organisation 'Children and Families Across
Borders' (formerly International Social Services) and/or the relevant
Consulate on all members of the household aged 10 and over.

In appropriate cases, a check will also be made that the applicants have
a right to work in the UK.

Where the applicant has made a previous application to foster or adopt,
the relevant agency must be asked to confirm in writing the outcome of
the application.

The administrative staff will record the dates when the checks were sent
and the dates when replies were received. The replies to the checks
should be placed in the confidential section of the applicant\'s record.

Where there are concerns about an applicant\'s circumstances as a result
of the information obtained from the above checks, this should be
referred to the fostering manager and the applicant may be advised not
to proceed with the application.

Where the checks reveal that the applicant or a member of the household
is a disqualified person (foster carer), see **Persons Disqualified from
Fostering Procedure**. The applicant will be advised not to proceed with
their application.

In any other case where there is doubt or where the applicant disagrees
with a decision not to proceed with the application and/or is not
willing to withdraw, an early referral should be made to the Fostering
Panel and the Agency Decision Maker. In these circumstances, a brief
report on the application should be presented to the Fostering Panel and
the procedure to be followed should be the same as if the report was a
full report on the applicants (see \*\*Section , The Panel
Recommendation \*\* to **Section, Representations / Independent Review
Procedure**).

If the information leading to a decision not to proceed relates to a
previous conviction of one of two joint applicants or a member of the
applicant\'s household, the details of the offence can only be disclosed
to the applicant with the consent of the relevant person; without such
consent, the applicant can only be informed that the reason relates to
information obtained from the checks but no details can be given.

Information relevant to the application that has been obtained from the
CRB may only be retained on the applicant\'s file for a limited period
and should be destroyed when a decision is made on the application. The
manager should note on the file that the CRB information has been
destroyed and that the information led to a particular view, without
citing the information itself.

## - Health

All applicants must agree to a full medical assessment conducted by
their GP on their health and any other relevant health issues.
Applicants will be given a BAAF Form AH Adult Health Report for the GP
to complete. The GP's fee for completing the report will be met by WF.

The report will be passed to the Medical Adviser to the Fostering Panel,
who should be asked to advise on the content and implications of the
report. This advice will be referred to in the report on the application
to the Fostering Panel.

Where the applicant\'s GP has expressed concerns or where clarification
of the implications of any health issues is required, detailed advice
must be sought from the Medical Adviser to the Fostering Panel at an
early stage and the implications fully discussed with the applicant. It
may be necessary for the Medical Adviser to speak directly to the GP or
for reports from other health professionals also to be obtained and
presented to the Medical Adviser and the Fostering Panel.

## - References

The applicants will be asked to provide the names of two personal
referees, who are adults, have known the applicants for at least 5 years
in a personal capacity and are not related to the applicants. In
addition, one personal reference will be obtained from a family member.

In the case of joint applications to foster, personal references should
adequately cover both applicants. Otherwise additional personal
references may be requested.

A further reference must be obtained from each applicant\'s current
employer. In addition, where the applicant has frequently changed jobs,
written references should also be obtained from past employers.

The administrative staff in the Fostering Team will send requests for
references enclosing standard forms for completion by the referees.

The assessing social worker will also interview the personal referees
and make a written record of the interview.

References from ex-partners should be obtained where there was joint
parenting of children and if the children are under 18 years at the time
of the assessment.

## - Home Study/Assessment

The application will be allocated to a qualified social worker for a
full assessment to be completed. Where the allocated social worker is
not experienced, he or she will conduct the assessment alongside an
experienced worker.

The time taken to complete the assessment from the receipt of the
application form until the presentation of the report to the Fostering
Panel will be a maximum of eight months. However, where an issue arises
during the course of an assessment which requires a decision as to the
future direction of the assessment and this cannot be resolved by
discussion between the assessing social worker and the applicant, or by
reference to the social worker's manager, consideration should be given
to the early referral to the Fostering Panel.

All fostering assessments will be completed on BAAF Form F using the
competence based model which requires evidence of:

Caring for children.

Providing a safe caring environment.

Working as part of a team.

Own development.

The assessment will also look at the applicants' understanding of and
ability to deal with children's behaviour including encouraging children
to take responsibility for their behaviour and helping them to learn how
to resolve conflict.

The assessing social worker will carry out a series of interviews with
the applicant(s).

All children living in the household will also be interviewed by the
assessing social worker as part of the assessment. This should be
conducted in an age and developmentally appropriate way.

In addition, all adults living in the household and adult birth children
who are living elsewhere should also be interviewed by the assessing
social worker.

The suitability of the accommodation must be assessed and a health and
safety checklist completed including an assessment of risk posed by any
pets in the household. Any issues relating to the accommodation that
arise from these checks should be recorded on the Form F.

The availability of bedrooms for fostered children should be discussed.
(The Fostering National Minimum Standards 2011 provide that each child
over 3 should have their own bedroom or, where this is not possible, the
sharing of the bedroom has been agreed by the placing authority.) WF do
not advocate the sharing of a bedroom unless it is two siblings under
the age of 10, and if this has been agreed with the placing social
worker. In exceptional circumstances WF will enter into discussions
should a request be made for two siblings to share a room over the age
of 10 years. This may occur following a request for a short term
emergency placement in order to provide an immediate safe environment
while assessment and further investigation takes place.

The assessment will take account of the outcome of the agency checks
carried out and references obtained. Applicants may be advised not to
pursue their application where it is considered that the application
would be refused having regard to information obtained from checks or
which indicates a prospective carer has attempted to cover up or
disguise information about offences (see **Section, Checks**). The
assessment will also take account of the information obtained and
observations made during the 'Skills to Foster' Training Course.
Applicants may be advised not to pursue their application where it is
considered that the application would be refused having regard to
information obtained during the course (see **Section, Skills to Foster
Training Course**).

The completed Form F should contain the outcome of the assessment and
recommendations of the assessing social worker, including the proposed
terms of approval for the foster parents.

The report should be shared with and signed by the applicant. It should
be explained to applicants that they have 28 days to do this, (or they
can be asked to sign a disclaimer stating they do not wish to take 28
days to comment) and that any written comments they make will be
circulated to Fostering Panel members, with the report.

The report should also be approved, signed and dated by the assessing
social worker's manager.

The Form F report will be supplemented by the assessment summary of the
applicant in the Skills to Foster Training Courses, a chronology and
evidence of required competencies. This assessment summary should also
be shared with the applicant prior to presentation to the Fostering
Panel and again they should be advised that they have a maximum of 28
days to comment.

This gives applicants the opportunity to make any comments on the
reports, for example by expressing disagreement or support for the
recommendations.

Applicants should be provided with a leaflet about Fostering Panel
before being invited to attend when their application is being
considered.

## - Presentation to the Fostering Panel

All the relevant information (incorporating the report from the Skills
to Foster Training Course, the applicant\'s comments, references, a full
written report on visits to the referees, chronology, completed Health
and Safety checklist, full information about all the statutory checks
and the Medical Adviser\'s report) should be sent to the Panel
Administrator 15 working days before the date of the Fostering Panel
meeting considering the application.

The assessing social worker should also inform the Panel Administrator
about the arrangements for the foster carers to attend the Panel meeting
and whether they require additional support such as an interpreter. The
decision to attend the Panel meeting rests with the applicants and a
wish not to attend will not prejudice consideration of their
application.

At the Panel meeting, the information will be presented by the social
worker responsible for the assessment or a substitute with adequate
knowledge of the applicant and the assessment.

Foster parents attending the Panel should be invited to give their views
or any comments on the application and the reports.

The applicant's views and wishes must be presented fairly and accurately
within the documentation before the Panel and verbally.

The Panel will consider the written report together with all the
supporting documentation and any additional information presented
verbally, and make a recommendation to the Agency Decision Maker
regarding the outcome of the assessment, including where approval is
recommended, the category of fostering recommended.

The recommendation will be recorded in writing and, where approval is
recommended, the category of fostering, any limitations of the approval
to named children or conditions as to the age range or number of
children to be placed in the foster home will also be specified.

Reasons for the recommendations, the category and any conditions will be
recorded in the Panel\'s minutes.

The applicant will be informed verbally by the chair of the Panel of the
recommendation at the outcome of the meeting or if the carers did not
attend, verbally within two working days.

## - After the Fostering Panel\'s Recommendation

After the Fostering Panel has considered the report and made a written
recommendation, the Panel Administrator will send the minutes to the
Agency Decision Maker to consider the recommendations for approval.

The Agency Decision Maker will consider all the reports and
recommendation and make a decision as to the suitability of the
applicant to foster within 7 working days of the Panel meeting. The
decision must be recorded, together with reasons.

Where the application is approved, the category and any terms of the
approval must be also specified in writing.

Arrangements will be made for the applicants to be given verbal
notification of the decision within 24 hours and written notice of the
decision, with reasons, signed by the Agency Decision Maker, within 5
working days of the decision.

If a decision is made to approve a foster parent, written notice of the
decision and the terms of the approval, signed by the Agency Decision
Maker, will be sent to the foster parent together with two copies of the
Foster Care Agreement (see **Section, After the Approval**).

## - Representations/Independent Review Procedure

If the Agency Decision Maker decides to refuse an application for
approval, written notice of the proposal to not to approve them together
with his/her reasons and a copy of the Fostering Panel\'s recommendation
will be sent to the applicant. The applicant will be advised that if he
or she wishes to challenge the decision, he/she has the right to make
written representations to the Fostering Panel within 28 days of the
date of the written notice of the decision or, as an alternative, to
apply to the Secretary of State to request a review of the decision by
an Independent Review Panel. Any such application must be made in
writing within 28 days of the notice of the decision and supported by
reasons.

The only circumstances where the foster parent will not have the right
to request a review by an Independent Review Panel is if he or she is
regarded as disqualified as a result of a conviction or caution for a
specified offence - see **Persons Disqualified from Fostering
Procedure**.

If no written notification of a request to make representations or for a
review is received within this period, the Agency Decision Maker's
decision to refuse the application can be confirmed.

If written representations are made within the period, the matter must
be referred back to the Panel for further consideration. Applicants who
wish to attend the meeting of the Fostering Panel can arrange for a
friend or supporter to accompany them. The Panel will hear any
representations and make a recommendation following this. The Panel may
uphold its recommendation or make a different recommendation as a result
of the applicant\'s representations. The Panel's fresh recommendation
will be sent to the Agency Decision Maker who will then proceed to make
his/ her decision within 7 working days of the Panel meeting. Written
notice of the decision and reasons will be sent to the applicant (signed
by the Agency Decision-Maker) within 2 working days of the decision.

If the applicant decides to refer the matter to an Independent Review,
the relevant Panel reports, any new information obtained since the Panel
meeting, a record of the decision made and reasons, a copy of the
written notification of the decision and a copy of the Panel minute, if
different, will be sent to the Independent Review within 10 working days
of their written request.

The procedure for the Independent Review is carried out by BAAF; the
applicant and two representatives of the fostering agency will be
invited to attend the Independent Review.

After considering the representations, the Independent Review may make a
recommendation, which the Agency Decision Maker will consider before a
final decision is made.

Written notice of the final decision, together with reasons, must be
sent to the applicant within 7 working days of the receipt of the
Independent Review recommendation.

## - After the Approval and the Foster Care Agreement

Where an application is approved, the foster parent will be allocated a
Supervising Social Worker from WF.

The Supervising Social Worker will request the foster parent to sign a
Foster Care Agreement between WF and the foster parent, which contains
the information the foster parent needs to carry out his or her
functions as a foster parent effectively. The foster parent will be
given two copies for signature, and will retain one signed copy.

The other will be kept on the foster parent case record, together with
the report and supporting documents presented to the Fostering Panel, a
copy of the Panel\'s recommendation and a copy of the approval decision.

The Foster Care Agreement will contain the following information:

      - The terms of the foster parent's approval
      - The support and training to be provided to the foster parent
      - The procedure for the review of the foster parent's approval
      - The procedure for placements of children
      - The procedure for making representations and complaints
      - The requirement to inform the fostering service of any change of circumstance, address or in the household composition, or of any registration as a child minder or application to adopt or of any offence
      - The requirements in relation to confidentiality
      - The procedures for behaviour management and unauthorised absences of children placed with the foster parent including the ban on corporal punishment
      - The procedures for informing the fostering social worker of the child's progress and any significant events relating to the child
      - The need to give 28 days' notice in writing of they wish to cease fostering

New foster parent will also be given their personal copy of the Foster
Parent\'s Hand-Book, which covers policies, procedures, guidance, legal
information and insurance details and in respect of which the foster
parent must sign confirmation of receipt.

They will need to provide the Supervising Social Worker with information
about their bank account and their availability to commence caring.

The allocated Supervising Social Worker will continue to provide support
to the foster parent up to, during and after all placements - see
**Chapters on Supervision, Training and Review of Foster Parents**.

## - Family Books/Profiles

Approved foster parent\'s should be asked by their Supervising Social
Worker to provide a Family Book or Profile. This should contain visual
and written information to introduce any child placed in the foster home
to members of the foster family and the foster home and to the
facilities and environment which are local to the parent. The
information should also contain house rules, routines, names of pets,
information about how the foster family has fun and any other
information to convey what it would be like for a child coming into the
household. The Family Book should also identify the approval details of
the parents, any special skills they have, the behaviours worked best
with and their willingness to manage contact with parents

This information will be used to identify the suitability of the
placement to meet the needs of specific children. It may also be sent to
referring social workers when the foster parents have been identified as
a potential match, and may be shared with the children in need of a
placement.

## - Register of Foster Parents

The Panel Administrator will update our register of foster parents which
is a list of all approved foster parents containing the following
particulars:

      - The name, address, date of birth, sex and ethnic origin of each foster parents
      - The date of approval and of each review of the approval
      - The category and current terms of the approval.
