title: 🛡️ Violent Extremism and Radicalisation Policy
---


## 📌 Purpose

This policy sets out how Wholistic Fostering identifies, prevents, and
responds to concerns about children and young people being exposed to
violent extremism or radicalisation.

The threat comes from a wide range of sources --- including religious
extremism (such as 'Islamic State'), far-right groups, and other
political ideologies. Protecting children from such risks is a key
safeguarding duty.

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

This policy is based on the **Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015**,
which introduced the **Prevent Duty**. Under this duty, specified
agencies must have \"due regard to the need to prevent people from being
drawn into terrorism.\"

Agencies covered by the duty include:

-   Local Authorities
-   Schools and registered childcare providers
-   Health Services
-   Prisons and Probation
-   The Police

    Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-duty-guidance)

## 🤝 Working in Partnership

Preventing radicalisation depends on strong multi-agency partnerships.
All staff and carers must cooperate with:

-   Local Prevent coordinators
-   Police and Local Authorities
-   Multi-agency safeguarding forums

## 📚 Understanding the Risk

All staff and foster carers must:

-   Understand what **radicalisation** means and why people may be
    vulnerable to it.
-   Recognise that **extremism** refers to vocal or active opposition to
    fundamental British values.
-   Know the link between **extremism and terrorism**.
-   Be able to spot early signs and concerns, and know how to report
    them.
-   Understand what action can be taken to prevent radicalisation.

## 🚨 What to Do if You\'re Worried

If you suspect a child is vulnerable to radicalisation:

-   **Speak to your Supervising Social Worker or the Registered Manager
    immediately**.
-   **Follow safeguarding notification procedures**.
-   If there is **immediate danger to life or safety**, **call 999**.
