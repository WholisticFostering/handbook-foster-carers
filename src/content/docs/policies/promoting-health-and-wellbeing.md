## Introduction and Underpinning Regulations and Standards

The health (both physical and emotional) of looked after children is
important and foster carers have a key role to play in this. Children
and young people who are looked after have often been disadvantaged in
their health needs being met and so when they are placed with foster
carers it is important that all their health needs are considered and
continue to be monitored.

The Fostering Regulations (2011) Regulation 15 state:

\<WRAP center round info 90%\> The fostering service provider must
promote the health and development of children placed with foster
parents.

In particular the fostering service provider must ensure that each
child:

is a registered patient with a general medical practitioner who provides
primary medical services under Part 4 of the National Health Service Act
2006,

has access to such medical, dental, nursing, psychological and
psychiatric advice, treatment and other services as the child may
require,

is provided with such individual support, aids and equipment which the
child may require as a result of any particular health needs or
disability the child may have, and

is provided with guidance, support and advice on health, personal care
and health promotion issues appropriate to the child's needs and wishes.
\</WRAP\>

Standard 6 of the National Minimum Standards for Fostering states:
\<WRAP center round info 90%\> Children's physical, emotional and social
development needs are promoted.

Children understand their health needs, how to maintain a healthy
lifestyle and to make informed decisions about their own health.

Children are encouraged to participate in a range of positive activities
that contribute to their physical and emotional health.

Children have prompt access to doctors and other health professionals,
including specialist services (in conjunction with the responsible
authority), when they need these services.

Children's health is promoted in accordance with their placement plan
and foster carers are clear about what responsibilities and decisions
are delegated to them and where consent for medical treatment needs to
be obtained.

Children's wishes and feelings are sought and taken into account in
their health care, according to their understanding, and foster carers
advocate on behalf of children.

Foster carers receive sufficient training on health and hygiene issues
and first aid, with particular emphasis on health promotion and
communicable diseases.

Foster carers receive guidance and training to provide appropriate care
if looking after children with complex health needs.

Medicines kept in the foster home are stored safely and are accessible
only by those for whom they are intended.

Foster carers are trained in the management and administration of
medication. Prescribed medication is only given to the child for whom it
was prescribed, and in accordance with the prescription. Children who
wish to, and who can safely keep and take their own medication, do so.

Foster carers keep a written record of all medication, treatment and
first aid given to children during their placement.

Any physical adaptations or equipment needed for the appropriate care of
the children are provided to foster carers. \</WRAP\>

The Fostering Guidance (2011) states: \<WRAP center round info 90%\>
Promoting the health of children and young people in foster care is very
important if they are to grow into mature, stable, well balanced adults.
Children often have poor health when they first become looked after, and
the fostering service has a duty to promote the health and development
of children placed with foster carers (regulation 15 and standard 6).
Attention must be paid to both their physical and emotional health.
Foster care must provide a healthy environment, where children's good
health and wellbeing is promoted, their health needs are identified and
services are provided to meet their needs.

The responsible authority, as corporate parent, is required to provide
good health care for the child or young person. They exercise this
responsibility in part through the standards they apply to commissioning
fostering services and in part through their care planning functions.
These care planning functions require the local authority to arrange to
monitor the health care of children and young people who are looked
after. They must arrange for health assessments, at regular intervals,
the development of a health plan for each looked after child and the
review of those health plans (covered in Volume 2).

The full range of statutory obligations and duties on local authorities
and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to support and promote the health of
looked after children is set out in statutory guidance.

Fostering services must be clear about the way they ensure that foster
carers and staff of the fostering service protect and promote the health
of children in placement. In particular they must make sure that each
child is properly registered with a GP, preferably their own prior to
being looked after, or if that is not possible, with a local GP. They
must make sure that each child sees a dentist regularly, is referred
where necessary to an optician and is provided with any aids or
equipment required by particular health needs or disability. These
responsibilities should be undertaken in conjunction with the child's
social worker.

Foster carers, with support from the fostering service, health
professionals and the child's social worker, are responsible for the day
to day health of children placed with them. Specific responsibilities of
foster carers should be set out in the child's health plan or short
break care plan, and the placement plan.

For children receiving short break care with foster carers,
responsibility for health care remains with the parents, but foster
carers will be responsible for maintaining a child's ongoing health
treatment during a short break, and for emergency treatment.

Where children have specific health issues or conditions, they should be
supported to manage them and to avoid any potential embarrassments or
difficulties. Where a child needs additional input to promote their
health, foster carers and staff of the fostering service need to work
with the social worker to ensure they have proper and immediate access
to other medical, psychological or psychiatric support needed. This
should be identified by the health assessment and set out in the health
plan.

When a need is identified by the child, the foster carer or the
supervising social worker in between scheduled health assessments or
looked after child reviews, the carer and social worker must be
proactive in ensuring that the need is met appropriately and in a timely
way.

As well as identifying and responding to needs, the fostering service
should ensure that each foster child is given good advice, support and
guidance as necessary on good health and personal care to enhance,
inform and supplement that provided by their school through Personal,
Health and Social Education (PHSE). This should include advice on
alcohol and illegal substance abuse, smoking, sex and relationships,
sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV), and protecting oneself
from infections such as hepatitis. This requirement does not apply to
short breaks, as the provision of guidance, support and advice on
health, personal care and health promotion issues remains the
responsibility of the child's parents.

Fostering services must ensure that foster carers have the relevant
skills and knowledge to be able to meet the health needs of children and
young people, administer basic first aid and minor illness treatment,
provide advice and support and where necessary meet specific individual
health needs arising from a disability, chronic condition or other
complex need. Training on health issues should be included in foster
carers' core training programme. This should cover basic health and
hygiene issues, first aid, health promotion and communicable diseases.

The manager of the fostering service should also ensure that any health
care professionals employed, retained or otherwise referred to by the
fostering service have appropriate professional qualifications, are
accessing continuing professional education and are using properly
accredited and professionally validated treatment methods.

Foster carers must be made aware of the policy of the fostering service
governing the administration of medication and recording of this. They
should make suitable arrangements for the safekeeping of medicines in a
place the child cannot access, unless it has been specified in the
placement plan that the child is capable of managing their own
medication. Whilst children should be supported to keep and administer
their own medication, care must be taken to ensure that they are
responsible enough to do so, or will be able to do so with adequate
support and oversight. Arrangements should be in line with those that
any good parent would make, taking account of the individual needs and
capacity of the child (standard 6).

Foster carers must be given, at the time a child is placed with them,
written permission from a person with parental responsibility to
administer first aid and non-prescription medication, and to consent to
any other form of medical or preventive treatment as may be agreed
within a scheme of delegated authority. This should be recorded in the
placement plan.

Proper care must be taken to ensure prescribed medicines are only
administered to the individual for whom they are prescribed. Foster
carers should keep a written record of all medication, treatment and
first aid given to children during their placement, in accordance with
the policy of the fostering service.

This document should also be read in conjunction with the Statutory
Guidance on Promoting the Health and Wellbeing of Looked After Children
(2009), which you can view by Clicking Here. This guidance is due to be
updated in the near future. \</WRAP\>

## Fostering Policy and Guidance

### Training for Foster Carers

First Aid training is completed during the foster carers assessment
process and this should be updated every 3 years. Achieving Health and
Wellbeing of Children in Care is a core module that carers should
complete as soon as possible after being approved but within 12 months.

Other planned training that carers can access will include:

-   Substance Misuse.
-   Distance Learning Module on Health (based on the Fostering Network
    Pathway series).
-   Online training on Self-Harming Behaviours, Children and Parental
    Mental Health Issues.
-   Promoting Health and Development.
-   Children and Parental Substance Misuse.
-   Infection Control.
-   Safe Use of Medication.
-   Sexual Development and Sexual Abuse.

All foster carers are also expected to complete the Medication Workbook
in line with the Essex Medication and Related Tasks Policy. This should
be signed off by the supervising social worker who has completed the
appropriate training to do this. Once signed off the Medication Workbook
needs to be reviewed annually.

Foster carers should also complete the Training, Support and Development
(TSD) induction standards within 12 months of being approved (or 18
months for family and friends carers). Part of this also includes
discussions regarding healthy care and medication and the carers role in
promoting the health of children and young people (Standard 3) as well
as ensuring that carers have an understanding of how to promote good
sexual health with children and young people (standard 5). Standard 5
also includes the area of carers promoting personal development and
enjoyment of leisure/recreational activities with the children and young
people that they work with.

If a child or young person in placement has specialist health care needs
appropriate training will be provided to enable to carer to undertake
these tasks. In these situations if substitute care is being arranged
for the child or young person the substitute carers also need to have
been appropriately trained by appropriate medical specialists.

The Health Plan or short break care plan for the child or young person
should be provided to the foster carer.

If a child or young person is able to administer their own medication
this should also be agreed at the placement planning meeting and agreed
as part of the care plan for the child or young person.

### Health Checks

All looked after children should receive an assessment of their health
when they enter care and then every 6 months if under 5 years or
annually if over 5 years.

Dental checks should be undertaken at least annually for all children
under 18 years of age. The dentist will advise if check-ups are needed
more frequently. Dentists will not register children under 2 years old,
however foster carers should take any children placed who are under two
years with them to their own check-ups so that the child gets used to
going to the dentist. This will then count as the child's check-up. It
is unlikely that the dentist will examine the child but may offer oral
health advice.

Optician appointments should be undertaken on a regular basis.

Foster Carers are responsible taking children and young people to health
appointments unless another arrangement has been agreed e.g. parents of
the child. The Personal Child Health record (Red Book) should be
presented at all health appointments so that the health professional can
record the actions. Carers can also record that child's health in the
Red Book.

In addition to this all children and young people over the age of 4
years should have a strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ)
completed on an annual basis. The foster carer where the child or young
person is placed is responsible for completing these.

### Storage of medication

Foster carers should keep medication stored safely. Health and Safety
checklists are also undertaken unannounced at least once a year, part of
this check is to ensure that medication is stored safely.

### Foster Carers recording

All foster carers are expected to record any medication that they are
given. It is the responsibility of the SSW to ensure that carers do know
how to do this and that accurate records are kept up to date. Foster
carers should also record if the child or young person is unwell. Any
serious illness or hospitalisation should be recorded and the social
worker and supervising social worker should be informed. In these
circumstances the incident process should also be recorded.

Getting medical help for the child or young person is most important.
However, with a serious illness it is crucial that the Social Worker is
informed as soon as possible so appropriate steps can be taken and
appropriate people informed. If a child or young person has any serious
health issues outside of office hours foster carers should contact the
out of hours foster care support line or the Emergency Duty Team to
inform them of the incident and subsequent actions.
