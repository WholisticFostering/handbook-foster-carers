## 🎯 Purpose

To ensure every child in foster care has their health and development
needs recognised, supported, and promoted through everyday care,
planning and partnership.

## 📘 Why this matters

Children in care often enter foster placements with unmet physical or
emotional health needs. Foster carers play a vital role in helping
children recover, grow, and thrive.

## 🛠️ Carer Responsibilities

Foster carers must:

-   Register children with a GP, dentist, and optician
-   Attend and support regular health checks
-   Promote a healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing, and self-care
-   Keep medication stored safely
-   Administer medication appropriately and record all medication given
-   Report any serious illness, injury, or hospitalisation
-   Complete health-related training and refreshers

    responsibilities

    (under 5s) or annually (5+)

## 💊 Medication

-   All medication must be stored safely and securely

    given
