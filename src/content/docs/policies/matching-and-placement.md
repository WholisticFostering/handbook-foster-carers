title: 🧩 Matching & Placement
---


At Wholistic Fostering, we believe every child deserves to be placed
with a foster family who can meet their needs and support their
identity, safety, and development.

We aim to ensure **planned, thoughtful placements** wherever possible.
However, we also recognise that some referrals are urgent. Even when
same-day placements occur --- such as with safeguarding concerns or
newly arrived asylum-seeking children --- **matching remains
essential**. We work quickly but carefully to match each child to the
most suitable carer.

## 📋 Referral Process

Our referral system is **child-centred, responsive and simple**. Most
referrals come from local authority commissioning teams and are recorded
using our internal form.

The referral process includes:

-   The Duty Social Worker and Duty Manager reviewing the referral
    against our agency's criteria.
-   Identifying potential carers with the experience and capacity to
    meet the child's needs.
-   Consulting the carer's Supervising Social Worker. If unavailable,
    their line manager is contacted.
-   Completing a risk assessment based on the information provided.
-   Logging all key decisions, with carers and the team kept informed
    throughout.

## 🎯 Matching Objectives

We aim to:

-   Understand the child's background, needs and care plan.
-   Identify carers who can meet the child's needs --- including
    cultural identity, age, language, religion, gender, and household
    composition.
-   Clarify Wholistic Fostering's role in supporting the placement.
-   Work in partnership with the child's social worker, family, and
    others.

If a match is agreed, the process may include:

-   Confirming the child's care plan and the Local Authority's
    expectations.
-   Sharing information about the foster carer and their household.
-   Planning an introductory visit or overnight stay where possible.
-   Arranging a formal placement date and sending written confirmation.

## 📑 Matching Report

Each matching report must consider whether the carer can meet the
child's needs in areas such as:

-   Ethnicity, language, religion, and culture
-   Emotional warmth and consistent care
-   Safety, stability, and guidance
-   Educational and social stimulation
-   Contact and transport needs
-   Access to relevant community resources
-   Integration into the carer's household and wider social network

This is especially important for transracial or transcultural
placements.

## ⚖️ Balancing Identity & Needs

Our aim is to meet the **full range of each child's needs**, with
priority given to their **identity and cultural heritage**.

Where not all needs can be matched immediately --- especially in
emergency placements --- we support **child-led decision-making** and
work closely with the placing authority to improve the match as soon as
possible.

Example: A French-speaking child from Zaire may feel most at home with a
Black African family, even if they don\'t speak French, due to shared
cultural and racial identity.

If the child's needs cannot be fully met within Wholistic Fostering, we
will work in partnership with the placing authority to support a move
that best serves the child.
