title: Matching and Placement
---


Wholistic Fostering is committed to ensuring that children are
appropriate matched and placed with approved foster carers who are
capable of providing a high standard of care.

We believed that planned placements are the essence of good practice,
but sometimes placements happen on the same day as the referral. This is
particularly true where there are child protection issues, or asylum
seeking children who have just arrived in the UK. It is essential at
these times to get as much information as possible from the Social
worker or the agency making the referral. Matching will still be of
paramount importance and the most suitable foster carer will be
approached.

## Referral Procedure

Our referral process is child-focused and we aim to make it as u ser
friendly as possible for all those concerned. Most of our referral are
generated from Local Authority commissioning departments officers. The
initial information is received and transcribed onto our initial
referral form.

      * The duty Social Worker will process all the arraignments generated from this initial starting point at the earliest opportunity so that referrals can be processed swiftly and efficiently.  Wholistic Fostering has a duty process that is followed.  
      * The duty Social Worker in consultation with the duty manager will decide whether a referral is within the admissions criteria for Wholistic Fostering 
      * The duty social worker will then try to identify an available foster carer/carers with the skills, qualities and experience of meeting the needs of the referral and this will be discussed with the Duty Manager
      * The supervising social worker that is attached to the foster carer is consulted as to the appropriateness of the referral and will attend planning/discussion or review meetings at every stage of the process.  This would be line with their duties and responsibilities. If the supervising social worker is unable to be contacted on the day of the referral the Duty Social Worker will discuss the referral with the supervising social workers line manager.  
      * The Duty Social Worker will undertake a risk assessment taking on board all available information and factors pertaining to the potential placement 

## Objectives

      * To discuss the information  contained in the referral form – the social  history and the needs of the young person 
      * To determine the prospective foster carers capacity to meet the needs of the young person in terms of their approval, age range, race, linguistic, ethnicity, culture, religion, background, qualities, household make-up and experience 
      * To identify the proposed task of  Wholistic Fostering and how this relates to the overall care plan 

Once it has been agreed that Wholistic Fostering will provide an
appropriate placement and can assist the young person and their social
Services Department, the contract arrangements are agreed as follows

      * To Clarify the Local Authority  Social Workers Role 
      * To broadly agree the young person’s Care Plan 
      * To enable the young person, their social worker, and significant other to gather information about the foster carer’s household 
      * To diarise an overnight or weekend stay, or to visit the home of the foster carers prior to admission (//this might not be applicable in the case of emergencyplacements//) 
      * To agree a date and make arrangements for admission 
      * Minutes of the meeting are circulated to all those parties in attendance at the pre placement planning meeting 

The above procedure will be specific to the child or young person
involved in that referral is informed by the initial risk assessment and
other reports provided by the placing authority

Full consideration must be given to the foster carers need for
additional equipment and support

## The matching report

The matching report must address the proposed foster carer's ability to
provide

      * Ethnic, cultural religious background compatibility or capacity to ensure these needs can be met 
      * Basic care for the chi ld, children or young person 
      * Ability to ensure the safety of the child, children or young person
      * Proven ability of providing emotional warmth for the child, children or young person
      * Effective stimulation fir the child, children or young person 
      * Guidance and boundaries for the child, children or young person
      * Stability for the child, children or young person 
      * Ability to meet contact requirements 
      * Ability to meet transport requirements 
      * Community resources as to whether it can meet the needs of the child, children or young persons 
      * Consideration must be given to the foster family’s social networks and family integration as this will have an impact on the child, children or young person. This is particular relevant when considering transracial/transcultural placements 

## Balancing the child's hierarchy of needs

To be placed with a family from the same or similar ethnic background
should be the key priority within the child's hierarchy of needs.

However, where a child or young person has a diverse hierarchy of needs
these should be prioritised, taking into account the wishes and feelings
of the child or young person and his or her family. A "good enough
"match to the child's full range of needs should then be sought, with
each case being considered on its own merits.

Language for instance, the language needs of a child or young person
will have particular significance for someone who is newly arrived here
and if no appropriate placement is immediately available then a decision
will need to be made as to which aspect of a child's identity is to be
given precedence. For example a newly arrived black French speaking
child from Zaire could feel most comfortable with another black African
family even though they were non French speaking but with whom they are
more likely to share some racial and cultural similarity than with a
French speaking white family. Any such decision should be led by the
wishes of the child or young person where ever this is possible to do
so.

Where it has not been possible for a child or young person to be placed
appropriately in an emergency such that their needs in terms of gender,
religion, ethnic origin, language, culture, disability and sexuality
cannot be adequately met, steps will be taken to achieve a suitable
placement as soon as possible. This may mean that the placing authority
will want to move the child to a placement outside of Wholistic
Fostering and as such we will deem to support this in the best interest
of the child.
