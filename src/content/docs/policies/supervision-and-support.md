lastUpdated: 2025-07-13
---


## 📌 Scope

This policy applies to **all approved foster carers**. It outlines how
Wholistic Fostering supervises and supports carers so they can provide
safe, high-quality care.

## 🧾 Legal Basis

-   National Minimum Standards for Fostering (2011), Standard 21
-   Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011

## 👋 Introduction

Every foster carer is assigned a **Supervising Social Worker (SSW)** who
provides guidance, support, and professional supervision.

The SSW helps ensure you:

-   Follow safe care practices
-   Meet training standards (e.g. TSD Workbook)
-   Stay updated with policies and best practice

Note: The **child's social worker** is responsible for decisions about
the child's Care Plan.

## 📅 Monthly Supervision

A **monthly supervision visit** is arranged with your SSW, covering:

-   Any personal/family impact of fostering
-   Wellbeing and progress of child(ren) in placement
-   Training and development
-   Safe care and health & safety
-   Foster carer's daily recording (signed by both parties)

Each visit is recorded on a supervision form and signed by both you and
your SSW. This record also informs your **annual review**.

## 📞 Ongoing Contact

Your SSW will also provide:

-   Weekly phone check-ins
-   Extra visits for support, if needed
-   8-weekly visits and monthly calls if you have no placements

We also provide **out-of-hours support** --- details are included in
your welcome pack and on the carers' website.

## 🚪 Unannounced Visits

At least **once a year**, an unannounced visit will take place to check:

-   Who is in the home
-   Who is caring for the child
-   General safety of the environment

Unannounced visits are recorded here: [Unannounced Visit

If you're not home, a note will be left.
