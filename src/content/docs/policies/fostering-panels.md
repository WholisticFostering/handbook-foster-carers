    service.

-   Individual members may also be requested to attend other relevant

are appointed. Panel member's performances are reviewed annually through
appraisal by the Panel Chair. The Panel Chair's appraisal is carried out
by the Agency Decision Maker with views on the Chair's performance
sought from other panel members.

The Panel Feedback forms also provide information about the performance
of the Chair, Vice Chair and panel members

### - Conflict of interest

There can be situations where a panel member knows or has worked with
the applicant or approved foster carer to be considered by the panel. It
is important that the panel member should declare an interest in such
situations. The panel member should say whether he or she thinks this
knowledge will prejudice their consideration of the case. If he or she
thinks so, they should not participate in that case and it is probably
best if they leave the room. If the panel member does not think their
knowledge will affect their consideration of the case, it will be the
responsibility of the Chair, possibly with the help of the professional
adviser, to make the final decision. It is important for panel members
to alert the professional adviser or Panel Chair as early as possible to
avoid a possible problem over quoracy.

### - Independent Review Mechanism (Fostering)

#### - Process

If the decision maker considers that an applicant is unsuitable to
become a foster carer/continue as a foster carer they must send them a
'qualifying determination' giving their reasons, and explaining that
they have 28 days within which to make a representation to the decision
maker or to apply to the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) for an
independent review. If no response is received within 28 days the
decision maker is free to implement the decision. If, within the 28 day
period the applicant/carer makes representation this must be considered
by the Panel and the decision maker must take account of the Panel
recommendation in reaching a decision. If an application is made to the
IRM then WHOLISTIC must supply the relevant document within 10 working
days. The decision maker must take account of the recommendations of
both the IRM and the fostering panel in making a decision.

#### - Legislation

Independent Review of Determinations (Adoption and Fostering)
Regulations 2009.

Powers to make Regulations implementing the IRM (Fostering) were
introduced by the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 and made under the
Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002.

The Regulations apply in relation to England and Wales.

### - Role of the panel

The Wholistic Fostering's Foster Care and Placement Panels were
originally established in April 2015 in accordance with the Children Act
1989, The Fostering Services Regulations 2002, and The National Care
Standards 2002 -- Section 9: Standard 30: Regulations: establishment of
fostering panel, meetings of fostering panel, functions of fostering
panel.

The establishment and role will be kept under review in line with
legislation particularly Fostering Regulations and Guidance and National
Minimum Standards 2011

In addition to these regulations and minimum standards, The Foster Care
and Placement Panels comply with The Wholistic Fostering\'s published
statements of Quality Assurance, Principles and Equal Opportunity. The
Foster Care and Placement Panels adhere to The Wholistic Fostering\'s
Confidentiality/Conflict of Interest Statement, and Data Protection Act,
with The Wholistic Fostering\'s Complaints Procedure applying and the
Child Protection and Safe Guarding Policy being of particular relevance.

The Wholistic Fostering\'s Foster Care and Placement Panels undertake a
significant role in the process of ensuring that the Agency's Foster
Carers are providing the best possible service for the Children
accommodated and that the accommodated Child's welfare is paramount.
This process is undertaken through the Granting and Termination of
Approval Status, Change in Approval Status and Variations/Exemption to
Approval Status.

provider issues a Qualifying Determination not to approve prospective
foster carers, or to withdraw or change the terms of an existing foster
carer's approval

Whenever a panel is set up from people on the Central List, one of those
members must be appointed as the Chair and either one or two must be

In order that any Panel is not unduly influenced by the fostering
service in carrying out its quality assurance role, Chairs must be an
independent person, e.g. not a foster carer, employee or trustee of the
IFP. A Vice Chair does not have to be independent but at the WHOLISTIC
the Chair and the Vice Chair are independent.

The role of the Panel Chair is central to the effective operation of the

are able to reach the right decisions based on the needs of children.
