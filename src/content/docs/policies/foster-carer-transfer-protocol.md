title: 📋 Foster Carer Transfer Protocol Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-01
---


This policy outlines how Wholistic Fostering supports and manages the
**transfer of foster carers** from one fostering provider to another, in
line with the Fostering Network's 2012 guidance. It ensures children's
welfare remains the **primary concern**, while respecting carers'
**right to choose** their fostering service.

## 🌟 Core Principles

-   The **welfare of children in placement** is paramount at all times.
-   Foster carers have the **freedom to move** between agencies without
    pressure or penalty.
-   All fostering providers should work to increase the **total pool of
    foster carers**, not just recruit from others.

## 🎯 Aims of the Protocol

-   Ensure continuity of care for any children in placement.
-   Minimise disruption and delay in the transfer process.
-   Provide clarity around financial arrangements.
-   Avoid undue influence or pressure on foster carers.

## 🔄 Recruitment of Foster Carers

Wholistic Fostering will **not approach individual foster carers** from
another service without that agency's knowledge.

However, we respect that carers may explore other fostering options and
may have **initial, confidential discussions** with us before informing
their current agency.

We will not proceed with any **assessment or placement offer** until the
carer has informed their current provider in writing.

## 📄 Transfers Without a Child in Placement

If a carer has **no child in placement**, the process is as follows:

-   The carer informs their current agency **in writing** that they
    intend to transfer.
-   Wholistic Fostering may then begin the assessment.
-   Once we are ready to approve the carer, the carer submits **written
    resignation** to their previous provider.
-   Their previous approval will automatically end **28 days** after the
    resignation is received.
-   We will approve the carer to coincide with this date to ensure **no
    gap** in approval status.

## 🧒 Transfers With a Child in Placement

When a carer has a child in placement:

-   The carer must notify their **current agency and the placing local
    authority** in writing.
-   Within 28 days, a **transfer planning meeting** must be held with:
-   The current agency
-   The new agency
-   The placing authority
-   The foster carer(s)

The meeting will review:

-   The impact on the child(ren)
-   Whether the placement can and should continue
-   Support needs under the new agency
-   Timing of resignation and approval
-   Views of children, birth families and IROs

If the placement is not continuing, the move must be completed within
**three months**, unless exceptional circumstances apply.

## 🧾 Sharing Information

-   The current agency must provide a **comprehensive reference** to
    Wholistic Fostering within 28 days.
-   This should include: approval history, placement details, skills,
    training, outcomes of any allegations, and most recent review
    report.
-   The carer may receive a copy, unless it contains confidential
    safeguarding information.
-   With the carer's written consent, we may review their **previous
    Form F** and case files.
-   We may rely on verified information from the previous agency, if it
    remains accurate and relevant.

If a carer is under investigation or subject to significant concerns,
the transfer assessment will be **paused** until resolved.

## 🎓 Training, Support & Development

-   Transferring carers must retain their **TSD workbook and
    certificate**.
-   If not previously completed, they must do so within **6 months** of
    approval with us.
-   Carers will be inducted into Wholistic Fostering\'s own policies and
    expectations.

## 💷 Financial Considerations

If a placement continues:

-   Wholistic Fostering will ensure foster carers receive **no less**
    than they previously earned.
-   Local Authorities will not be charged more than what they paid the
    original provider, unless additional services are agreed.
-   Payment rates will apply for the **duration of the placement**,
    adjusted only for age band or inflation increases.

## 🔚 Final Notes

This protocol is not intended for use in **block transfers**, e.g., when
a contract is awarded to a new provider.

Wholistic Fostering is committed to ethical practice, respectful
transitions, and **child-centred decision making** throughout any
transfer process.
