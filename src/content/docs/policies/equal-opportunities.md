## Introduction

Good Practice in equalities benefits all people. WF acknowledges that
quality of life for many people has been undermined by discrimination
and disadvantage. People's experiences of discrimination are both wide
and varied and need to be believed and acted upon. WF purpose is for
this policy is to stop discrimination and improve quality of life for
all. WF recognises that this will improve the quality of its workforce
and the services they deliver.

## Principles

WF aims to adhere to the following principles:

      * Placing good equalities practice at the core of all activities
      * Challenging past and continuing discrimination
      * Listening and responding to individuals, service users and staff
      * Ensuring that its commitment is an ongoing process.

## Statement of Intent

WF will treat all people with dignity and respect, recognising the value
of each individual. The agency is committed to eliminating all forms of
discrimination in service delivery and employment on grounds of race,
gender, disability, age, sexuality and religion.

### Equality on the grounds of race

WF recognises the harmful effect that racism has on black and ethnic
minority people both in service delivery and employment. The agency will
take immediate steps to rectify discriminatory practice. The agency will
acknowledge and value diversity as an asset to build on.

In service delivery the agency will recognise diversity, for example in
language, dress or faith, and will respond sensitively to the different
needs of different groups of people and promote the positive value of
that diversity within the community.

In employment the agency recognises that there is an
under-representation of black and ethnic minority ethnic staff and will
develop structures, policies and training which ensures this is
addressed.

### Equalities on the grounds of gender

WF recognises the harmful effect of sexism and discrimination on grounds
of gender.

Negative attitudes and prejudices lead to sexual harassment and
discrimination both in service delivery and employment. Equalities on
the grounds of disability

WF recognises the many effects of discrimination against people living
with a disability. Negative attitudes, prejudices and physical barriers
can lead to discrimination and harassment, both in service delivery and
employment. In service delivery the agency will recognise the differing
needs of disabled people and seek to address them.

### Equalities on the grounds of age

WF recognises the harmful effect of ageism and believes that it
undervalues older as well as younger people and gives unfair advantage
to people within certain age groups. WF recognise that older people's
experiences must be valued and they must not be denied equal chances for
continuous development. Young people must also be given opportunities
for training and work experience in order to enhance their employment
opportunities.

### Equalities on the grounds of sexuality

WF recognises the effects of hetero-sexism and homophobia within the
society. Negative attitudes and prejudices lead to harassment and
discrimination. The agency will work in partnership with other agencies
to eliminate harassment, hate crimes and violence by taking preventative
measures and prosecuting where appropriate.

### Equalities on the grounds of religion and faith

WF recognises the harmful effect that discrimination has on people of
different beliefs. The agency will ensure sensitivity with regard to
people's faith and not deliver services in a way that is offensive. The
agency will work closely to develop a wider understanding of other
people's diverse sensitivities and needs. People must be able to
practice their faith in safety without fear of harassment or
discrimination.

## Legislation

WF will comply with all anti discriminatory legislation including the
Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Updated 1986), the Equal Pay Act 1970
(Updated 1983), The Race Relation (Amendment) Act, the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995, updated 2005 the Crime and Disorder Act 1988,
