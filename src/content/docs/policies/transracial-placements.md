title: 🧒🏽 Guidance for Transracial Placements
---


## 📌 Purpose

To help ensure that children placed with foster families of different
racial, cultural, or linguistic backgrounds receive sensitive, informed,
and empowering care that supports their identity and wellbeing.

## 📚 Legal Framework

Relevant legislation and guidance includes:

-   **Article 20 UNCRC** -- Respect for cultural and linguistic
    heritage.
-   **Children Act 1989, Section 22** -- Ethnic, cultural and religious
    needs must be considered in placements.
-   **DoH Guidance on Adoption** -- While ethnic matching is important,
    it must not lead to unnecessary delays.

## 🤝 Core Principles

### 🧭 Identity and Belonging

Children must be supported to develop a strong, positive sense of who
they are. Carers should actively promote cultural pride, provide role
models, and help children navigate identity, race, and heritage.

### 🧑‍🎓 Foster Carer Expectations

Carers must:

-   Understand the impact of racism and discrimination.
-   Help children develop resilience and self-worth.
-   Offer access to cultural and community networks.
-   Show curiosity and respect toward the child's background.

### 📒 Assessing Placement Suitability

Consider:

-   Cultural competence and openness of carers.
-   Diversity in the household and local community.
-   Ability to meet dietary, religious, linguistic and hair/skin care
    needs.
-   Strategies for promoting cultural identity and managing racism.

### 🧬 Children of Mixed Heritage

Match with carers who reflect the child's full or main cultural heritage
when possible. If not, carers should be supported to meet those needs
with additional resources or community links.

## 🔍 Decision-Making Factors

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Siblings

Siblings should be kept together whenever possible, even if that means
some children are placed transracially. Identity support must be part of
the placement plan.

### 🏘️ Location

Avoid isolating placements. Ensure children can connect with peers or
community networks that reflect their background.

### 🏫 Education

Maintain school placements where possible to provide continuity and
support networks.

### 🙏 Religion

Take care to distinguish between racial similarity and religious
compatibility. Place children in environments that respect and support
their religious practice.

### 🛐 Parental Contact

Prioritise safeguarding when it comes to restricted contact. Otherwise,
try to keep placements geographically practical for maintaining family
links.

## 🛠️ Training & Support

All foster carers must receive training on:

-   Anti-racist practice
-   Cultural awareness
-   Supporting children with identity development

All staff involved in placement planning should also receive regular
training to ensure competence and sensitivity.

## 🗂️ Recording and Care Planning

Each child's ethnicity, culture, language, and religion must be clearly
recorded. Their care plan should specify how these needs will be met.
Where there is a mismatch, support must be put in place to bridge the
gap.

## 🆘 Emergency & Short-Term Placements

Where urgent placements must be made without ethnic matching, steps
should be taken to:

-   Address cultural needs as soon as possible
-   Reassess the suitability of long-term arrangements

## 🔁 Converting Short-Term to Permanent

Before converting short-term transracial placements to long-term, assess
the carer's ongoing ability to meet the child's cultural needs.
Children's wishes and understanding of identity must be fully explored
and supported.
