title: 🤝 Foster Carer Retention Policy & Procedure
---


Wholistic Fostering is committed to **valuing and retaining foster
carers**. Foster carers are central to the success of the agency.
Retaining experienced carers improves outcomes for children and
strengthens the agency's services.

We recognise that carers have choices, and excellent **support, respect,
communication and recognition** are essential to carer satisfaction.

## 💡 Our Approach

Carers stay with agencies where they feel:

-   Valued
-   Supported
-   Part of a professional, trusted team

Supervising Social Workers (SSWs) play a key role in this. The
day-to-day support, supervision and responsiveness of SSWs is directly
linked to a carer's sense of stability and confidence.

We promote a team culture where staff and carers attend training
together and work in partnership toward shared goals.

## 🔄 Day-to-Day Retention Practice

Every action matters -- from **returning phone calls** to **recognising
achievements**. Our culture expects attention to detail, warmth, and
professionalism from everyone.

We want carers to:

-   Feel heard
-   Influence positive change (e.g. through a Carer Representative)
-   Receive regular placements
-   Be well-trained and well-matched

## 🛑 Why Carers Leave (Common Issues)

-   Lack of placements
-   Poor or infrequent support
-   Inadequate training or development
-   Poor communication or slow response times
-   Feeling undervalued or isolated
-   Better fees/conditions elsewhere
-   Persuasion by Local Authorities to transfer

## ✅ Key Retention Practices

-   Clear policies and standards from first contact
-   Open, honest communication -- no secrets
-   Regular visits and supervision
-   24/7 support and advice line
-   Respite and outreach when needed
-   Skilled carer recruitment and child matching
-   Early response to placement instability
-   Fun, meaningful training and development
-   Peer support groups and social events
-   Carer-led groups and forums
-   Recognition and praise at reviews
-   Thank-you cards, small gifts, gestures of appreciation
-   Carer Rep on management committee
-   Quick and courteous communication
-   Clear complaints process, handled locally where possible
-   Realistic and gradual introduction to fostering
-   Consistent, on-time payments

## 🧑‍💼 Management Involvement

The **Management Committee** ensures service quality and includes a
**Carer Representative** to share honest feedback and help shape
improvements.

## 📬 Carer Resignations

Not all resignations are negative --- some carers leave due to
retirement or family changes. However, where concerns exist about a
carer's practice, these must be investigated **before** accepting a
resignation.

We always seek to understand why a carer is leaving. Even seemingly
minor concerns can be important, and carers may hesitate to raise them.
Open discussion can often prevent future resignations.

## 📘 Exit Interviews

An **exit interview** will be arranged for every resignation. This helps
us improve the service and understand what led to the decision.

Key points:

-   Interviewed by someone not directly involved with the carer
-   Findings are written up and shared with relevant managers
-   Themes and learning are fed back into agency development

## 📜 Legal Framework

Under fostering regulations:

-   A carer resigns by writing to the agency
-   Resignation takes effect 28 days after written notice is received
-   If children are in placement, **extra planning is required**

Where children are placed, Wholistic Fostering will refer to the
**Fostering Network\'s Transfer Protocol** for guidance.
