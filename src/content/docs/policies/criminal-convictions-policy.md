title: ⚖️ Criminal Convictions Policy
---


## 📘 Purpose

This policy sets out Wholistic Fostering's approach to criminal record
checks and how we respond when foster carers or applicants have criminal
convictions. It ensures that safeguarding is always prioritised.

## 👥 Who This Applies To

This policy applies to:

-   All fostering applicants
-   Approved foster carers
-   Household members aged 16+
-   Any adult with significant or unsupervised contact with children in
    placement

## 🔍 Background Checks

Enhanced **DBS (formerly CRB)** checks will be carried out:

-   At application stage
-   Every 3 years thereafter
-   On any new adults joining the household

Children in the household (under 16) will not be DBS checked, but
parents must sign a declaration confirming no known criminal history.

Support network members will only be checked where they have significant
unsupervised contact, in line with LAC 2004 (04) guidance on overnight
stays.

DBS results are confidential. Staff must seek management guidance before
disclosing any results to others.

## ❌ Disqualifying Offences

Certain offences automatically **disqualify** a person from fostering.
These include:

-   Offences against a child under Section 26 of the Criminal Justice
    and Court Services Act 2000
-   Sexual offences (including those committed abroad)
-   Importation or distribution of indecent images of children
-   Any violent crime against a child

If these appear on a DBS check, **the assessment will not proceed**.

Failure to disclose past convictions---particularly if discovered
later---may be viewed more seriously than the conviction itself due to a
breach of trust.

## 🔁 Existing Carers

Approved carers must immediately notify WF if they are:

-   Arrested
-   Charged with an offence
-   Convicted of any offence

Failure to do so may lead to suspension or deregistration. A review will
usually be triggered and presented to the fostering panel.

## 📣 Notifying Others

Where appropriate, the placing Local Authority will be informed. A child
may be removed from placement depending on the nature of the offence.

## 🧭 Making Decisions

Offences not on the automatic ban list are assessed on:

-   Type and seriousness of offence
-   Time since the offence
-   Number and pattern of offences
-   Any evidence of rehabilitation

The Registered Manager will decide whether:

-   The applicant can proceed with assessment
-   An existing carer should be referred to panel

Final decisions are made by the Agency Decision Maker, with reference to
panel advice and safeguarding concerns.

## 🗂️ Record Keeping

DBS returns are checked against self-declared information in the Form F
assessment.

Where a criminal record is disclosed:

-   The Supervising Social Worker and Registered Manager must be
    informed
-   The result and date are logged in the carer's file
-   Discrepancies are reviewed and next steps decided by the Registered
    Manager

All findings are documented in carer reviews and assessment records.
