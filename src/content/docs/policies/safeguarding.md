lastUpdated: 2025-07-11

Every foster home must have a Safe Caring Family Policy in place,
setting out household routines, rules, and boundaries that promote safe,
respectful and nurturing care for all children. It is completed with
support from your Supervising Social Worker and is a requirement before
any child is placed.

## 📘 What is a Safe Caring Family Policy?

A short written plan that:

-   Helps keep children safe from harm or abuse
-   Reduces the risk of allegations against foster carers
-   Makes clear how safe caring is practiced in your home

Safe Caring Policies are updated:

-   Before a child is placed
-   With each new placement
-   When household circumstances change
-   Annually as part of your foster carer review

## 👪 Who Completes It and When?

-   During assessment -- with your assessing worker
-   After approval -- with your Supervising Social Worker
-   Existing carers -- update it with your SSW when a child is placed or
    annually

Everyone in the household should be part of creating and reviewing it.
Older children should also be involved where appropriate.

## 🧭 What Should It Include?

The policy should cover:

-   🛏️ Bedroom access and privacy
-   🛁 Bathing and dressing boundaries
-   🚗 Transport safety and car use
-   📸 Photos, social media and internet use
-   💬 Safe language and affection
-   🚷 Managing bullying and safe play
-   🔥 Fire safety plan
-   📅 Rules around babysitting and going out
-   🧑‍🦽 Additional care for children with disabilities
-   🏡 Visitors and regular guests
-   ✍️ Rules and values shared by the household

## 📌 Key Principles

-   Show warmth, care and respect
-   Avoid confusion about roles (e.g. children should not call carers
    "mum" or "dad")
-   Respect children's personal space and belongings
-   Give clear, age-appropriate messages about body safety, consent and
    boundaries
-   Maintain safe supervision -- especially when children play together
-   Foster carers must **never use corporal punishment**
-   Keep a copy of your policy accessible in the home

## 📄 Recording and Support

-   Use your **daily logbook** to record relevant incidents or concerns
-   Discuss any worries during **supervision**
-   Attend safer caring training regularly
-   Contact your SSW if unsure about how to respond to new situations

## 🧾 Templates and Tools

Your Supervising Social Worker will provide a Safe Caring Policy
template. Additional documents like risk assessments or house rules can
be included where needed. This policy is signed off by a Fostering
Manager.
