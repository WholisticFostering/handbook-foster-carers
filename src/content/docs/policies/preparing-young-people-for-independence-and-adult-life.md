title: 📋 Preparing for Independence & Adult Life Policy
lastUpdated: 2025-07-12

At Wholistic Fostering, we support every child and young person to
develop life skills so they can grow into confident, independent adults.
This work starts early and continues throughout their time in placement,
regardless of age or ability.

We follow National Minimum Standard 12 -- **Promoting Independence and
Transition to Adulthood** -- and work closely with carers, young people,
and local authorities to make this journey thoughtful, empowering, and
realistic.

## 🛠 Life Skills in Foster Care

Foster carers play a key role in helping children and young people
develop essential daily living skills, including:

-   Cooking, laundry, and basic home maintenance
-   Money management, budgeting, and banking
-   Shopping and understanding value for money
-   Booking appointments and navigating health services
-   Travel planning and using public transport
-   Learning about safety in the home and community
-   Understanding personal hygiene and self-care
-   Building confidence with communication and social skills

These skills are introduced gradually and tailored to the child's
developmental stage and ability. Children are supported in taking on
responsibility in a safe, nurturing way --- just as any good parent
would offer.

## 📈 Building Towards Independence

As young people move into their mid-teens, we encourage:

-   Managing pocket money and opening bank accounts
-   Greater independence in making and attending appointments
-   Involvement in preparing meals and running errands
-   Understanding how household bills and rent work
-   Talking openly about adult life, including work, education, and
    relationships

Foster carers and supervising social workers monitor and support this
progress through the care and pathway planning process.

## 🚪 Leaving Care & Pathway Planning

When a young person turns 16, the local authority must create a
**Pathway Plan**. We actively support this process alongside the social
worker, personal adviser, young person, and carer.

Wholistic Fostering uses the **\"Let's Get Started\"** programme to help
prepare young people for this next step. We focus on:

-   Practical and emotional readiness
-   Exploring housing, finances, education, and employment
-   Maintaining safe, supportive relationships
-   Coordinating with relevant services like health, benefits, and
    housing

Young people with disabilities or additional needs receive tailored
support to bridge the transition into adult services.

## 🏠 Staying Put

Where appropriate, we support young people to **\"Stay Put\"** with
their foster carers beyond age 18. This helps avoid abrupt transitions
and allows more time for development and planning.

Staying Put arrangements are agreed with the local authority and
reviewed to ensure they remain in the young person's best interests.
