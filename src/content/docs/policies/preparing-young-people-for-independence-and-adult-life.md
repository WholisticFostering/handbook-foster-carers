title: Preparing Young People for Independence and Adult Life
---


## Scope

This chapter explains the way in which the fostering agency promotes
independence for young people in its foster placements.

This chapter is compliant with National Minimum Standards for Fostering
2011, Standard 12 Promoting independence and transition to adulthood

## Preparation for Independence

Regardless of the age of the young person in the placement, their need
to develop skills so that they can become as independent as possible
should be borne in mind and they should be encouraged to take
responsibilities when they are able to do so.

Foster carers are expected to give the young person opportunities at
appropriate times to practice independence tasks such as cooking,
washing and ironing, within the foster home.

Young people should, from time to time, be involved in supermarket
shopping with the carers and should be helped to compare value for money
of different items. They should be helped to understand the relative
expense of convenience foods and of fresh foods.

Foster carers should help children learn to prepare food and drinks,
from making tea and coffee, to preparing cold and later hot snacks, and
on to preparing simple meals. Sometimes, a camping, caravanning or
self-catering holiday can provide a fun opportunity to develop these
skills.

As the child matures, they should gradually be given responsibility for
paying for certain of their own needs from their pocket money. Examples
could include comics or magazines, leisure activities, toiletries and
mobile phone vouchers.

These expectations should gradually be increased as the young person
reaches the age of 15. By the time they reach this age, unless
inappropriate because of their level of understanding, they should be
encouraged to open a bank or building society account in their own name,
and should be helped to do this themselves.

Foster carers should use the ordinary course of events within their
household to make children aware of the process of paying bills, and of
the ease with which debts can build up when offers of loans are
constantly dropping through the letter box. Young people should be
helped to understand the dangers of this.

## Leaving Care

The fostering agency will actively support and participate in preparing
and reviewing the young person's Pathway Plan and, as part of this the
foster carers should support the Personal Adviser to identify the ways
in which they can provide practical, financial and emotional support to
young people as they become independent. WF have devised a leaving care
programme entitled 'Let's get started'. Supervising social workers will
work with the Personal Advisor, Foster Carer and the young person to
implement this programme.

# PREPARATION FOR ADULT LIFE

//**17.1 UK National Standard 12: Preparation for Adult Life** //

Each child or young person in foster care is helped to develop the
skills, competence and knowledge necessary for adult living; she or he
receives appropriate support and guidance for as long as necessary after
being in foster care. (See Pathway Plan)

Wholistic Fostering has a clear leaving care policy statement which
meets statutory requirements, is well publicised, fully integrated
within its children' services plan, and monitored and regularly
reviewed.

Each young person preparing to leave foster care is consulted about her
or his future and encouraged to be actively involved in decision-making
processes and the implementation of agreed plans. This takes the form of
a Pathway Plan.

The care plan for each young person preparing to leave foster care
clearly states the work to be undertaken, by whom, and when, with
particular reference to the role of the foster carer in preparing the
young person of independent living.

Each carer receives training and support to enable her or him to provide
effective support and guidance to a young person preparing to leave
foster care.

Each young person leaving foster care receives a comprehensive,
accessible leaving care guide; this includes details of continued
support available.

Each young person leaving foster care is provided with full, clear
information on the financial support available; in the manner of a good
parent, Wholistic Fostering ensures that the young person has an income
from appropriate sources sufficient to maintain her/himself within the
community.

Each agency and other leaving care provider has effective joint working
arrangements with housing agencies, education, employment and training
services and benefit providers to support each young person leaving
care.

The needs of each disabled young person leaving foster care are
identified, recorded and addressed in co-operation with appropriate
health and education authorities; where appropriate particular attention
is paid to co-ordinating transition of support and care provision from
children's to adult services.

Each young person leaving care for independent living can chose a safe
and affordable accommodation, with support systems where necessary,
which takes into account the young person's individual preferences and
need to maintain relationships both with her or his own family and with
foster carers.

Financial and other support is made available to each carer able to
offer care and support to a young person they have fostered during the
transition to independent living and in the period immediately after
leaving care.

Each agency monitors and evaluates the outcomes of its leaving care
services and applies its findings to future services planning.

\*\**National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services, Standard 12
states Children are prepared for, and supported into, adulthood so that
they can reach their potential and achieve economic wellbeing* \*\*

## Leaving Care

The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 has been implemented to ensure that
young people leaving the care of the Local Agency have a plan for their
future and continue to be supported. Every Local Agency has a duty to
assess and meet the needs of eligible and relevant young people aged 16
and 17 year old.

To be eligible a young person has to be aged 16 or 17 and be looked
after.

To be relevant a young person has to be 16 or 17 and previously looked
after for a minimum of 13 weeks. Young people who are 18+ and were
looked after by a Local Agency will be termed former relevant children.

Each Social Service Department has a duty to keep in touch with young
people who have left the care of the Local Agency and that they receive
the support they require. This duty ends at the age of 21 years unless a
young person continues in training or education in which case it can
continue until the age of 24. Every young person will have to have a
Young Person's Pathway Adviser they will monitor the progress of each
young person for whom they are responsible and provide advice and
support. Each young person will also have a Pathway Plan, which will
plan ahead until they are at least 21 and will be reviewed every 6
months. This will cover all aspects of a young person's life from the
practical aspects of living more independently to family and social
relationships. The Leaving Care Act is recognition of the vulnerability
of young people who have been looked after and it is there to ensure
that guidance and help is available if required.

Young people who are in care or are care leavers and are 16 or 17 will
not be eligible for Job Seekers Allowance or Income Support. The Social
Services Department must provide financial support for them. Young
people can remain with their foster carer or will be helped to identify
independent accommodation. They will also be given support to enter
education, training or work. Young people from the age of 18 to 21 can
claim benefits but Social Services will continue to have a duty to
advise and assist. Carers can be offered supportive lodging allowances
for all young people of 18+ where the plan is that they remain in their
foster placement. Wholistic Fostering Services will seek to act in the
young person's interest and will negotiate on behalf of the carer and
child.

Young people who are being looked after should start to learn self help
skills at a basic level when entering their teens and should be well
advanced in them by the time they leave care. Young people with a
disability may have faced particular barriers to acquiring the skills
and experiences listed below. Whatever the reason for them, these
barriers will need to be addressed, with the aim of increasing the young
person's ability to make choices, take risks and assume responsibility

## PREPARATION FOR LEAVING CARE

Identity and cultural background should be presented in a realistically
positive light and not as something about which to feel defensive. The
use of life work may be helpful in achieving this end, but Wholistic
Fostering Trusts and other agencies looking after children will need to
ensure that young people are enabled to accept themselves and their
backgrounds emotionally and not simply intellectually.

Young people leaving care will need preparation in acquiring practical
and financial skills. These include:

      * how to shop for, prepare and cook food;
      * eating a balanced diet;
      * laundry, sewing and mending and other housekeeping skills;
      * how to carry out basic household jobs such as mending fuses and basic electrical knowledge
      * safety in the home and first aid
      * household budgeting
      * health education, including personal hygiene
      * sexual education, including sexual health, contraception and preparation for parenthood
      * applying for, and being interviewed for, a job;
      * the rights and responsibilities of being an employee;
      * the rights and responsibilities of being an employer (disabled young people may use direct payments to employ their own personal assistants);
      * applying for a course of education or training;
      * applying for housing, becoming a tenant and maintaining the tenancy;
      * registering with a doctor and dentist;
      * knowledge of emergency services (fire, police, ambulance);
      * finding and using community services and resources;
      * contacting social services and other caring agencies;
      * the role of agencies such as the Citizen’s Advice Bureau, local councillors and MPs/MLAs; and
      * how to write a letter of complaint or to seek advice.

Young people who are being looked after should start to learn self help
skills at a basic level when entering their teens and should be well
advanced in them by the time they leave care. Young people with a
disability may have faced particular barriers to acquiring the skills
and experiences listed above. Whatever the reason for them, these
barriers will need to be addressed, with the aim of increasing the young
person's ability to make choices, take risks and assume responsibility.

## Staying Put

WF will support the work of the local authority in their duties to help
young people to 'Stay Put' and avoid an unnecessary or premature move to
independence due to their chronological age, namely 18 years.

If it proposed that a young person stay with the agency foster carers
beyond the age of 18, the foster carers will be assessed in terms of
their ability to meet the young person's needs into adulthood.
