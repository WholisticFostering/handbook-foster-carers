title: 📄 Representations / Independent Review Procedure
---


## 📌 Scope

This procedure applies when a decision is made **not to approve** a
foster carer application. It sets out the applicant's right to challenge
the decision, either by **making written representations** or by
requesting an **Independent Review**.

## ❌ When Reviews Are Not Allowed

Applicants **cannot** request an Independent Review if they are
**disqualified** due to a **conviction or caution for a specified
offence**. → See: [Persons Disqualified from Fostering
Procedure](/policies/persons_disqualified_from_fostering)

## 🔁 Right to Challenge a Decision

If an application is refused, the applicant will receive written notice,
which will include:

-   The reasons for the refusal.
-   Their right to:
    -   **Submit written representations** within **28 days** **OR**
    -   **Request an Independent Review** by the Secretary of State (via
        IRM) within **28 days**.

If neither response is received within 28 days, the decision will be
**confirmed** and the application closed.

## ✍️ Submitting Written Representations

If the applicant chooses to submit **written representations**:

-   The case will be reconsidered by the **Fostering Panel**.
-   The Panel Advisor will arrange a date and notify the applicant
    within **7 days**.
-   The applicant may attend the meeting and bring a **friend or
    supporter**.

After the meeting:

-   The Panel will review the case, taking into account the
    representations.
-   A new recommendation will be sent to the **Agency Decision Maker**.
-   If the decision is still not to approve:
    -   The applicant will be informed **verbally within 2 working
        days**.
    -   **Written confirmation** and reasons will be sent **within 7
        working days**.
    -   The applicant will receive information about the **Complaints
        Procedure**.

All documents --- including reports, minutes, recommendations, and
decisions --- will be kept on the applicant's file.

## 🕊️ Independent Review (IRM) Process

If the applicant chooses the **Independent Review (IRM)** route:

-   The request must be made **in writing within 28 days** of the
    decision.
-   The agency must send the following to the IRM **within 10 working
    days**:
    1.  All original panel reports
    2.  New information since the decision
    3.  The decision and reasons
    4.  Panel minutes
    5.  Notification letter to the applicant

→ IRM is operated by **BAAF** (or current provider) and includes:

-   A review meeting with the applicant
-   Two representatives from the fostering agency

The IRM will make a **recommendation**, which the **Agency Decision
Maker** will consider before making a final decision.

The final decision will be:

-   **Sent in writing within 7 working days** of receiving the IRM
    recommendation.

If the decision is to **approve** the application, the process will
