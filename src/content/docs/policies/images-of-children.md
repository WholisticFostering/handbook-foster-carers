## Introduction

It is important for you to be aware of the protocol on the use of
photography or videos with looked after children that social workers are
expected to follow. The next section provides you with this guidance
then is followed by guidance to foster carers on the use of photos or
videos with children in placement.

## Guidance for social work staff

The purpose of having a protocol is to protect children/young people
from the use of photography in such a way that is, or has the potential
to be, abusive or exploitative. It is also important for staff to have
clear guidelines in order to protect them from allegations that they are
using photography of children/young people in an inappropriate way.
Workers should also be sensitive to what photography might mean for a
child/young person in that it may have been used abusively with some
children/young people.

It is recognised that taking photos or videos of children/young people
is a legitimate, and indeed an essential part of working with them, such
as the recording of activities, at the request of the child or young
person themselves, or for life story work. In all such situations staff
should alert their line manager to the fact that photos or videos are
being used and this should be recorded clearly in supervision notes.

## Protocol to be followed by Wholistic staff when photographing or taking videos of children/young people

-   The use of photography or reproduction of photographic images or the
    use of videos must always have a clear and child-centred purpose.
-   Prior to the taking of any photo or video the purpose of this should
    be explained to the child or young person according to their age,
    development and understanding and to the parent/carer unless there
    are specific reasons not to do so in which case the child's/young
    person's social worker must give permission. A child or young person
    should not be photographed if they do not wish to be or if their
    parent/carer/worker does not wish them to be.
-   In relation to one-to-one work by staff with children, written
    consent must be gained from the child's social worker or
    parent/carer and placed on the child's file unless the young person
    is clearly of an age and understanding to give informed consent on
    their own behalf. Key workers must then check that consent is on the
    child's file before taking images. For the purpose of group
    activities when photography is frequently used, carers/social
    workers should be notified and written consent gained.
-   Children/young people must be clothed and their torsos covered when
    being photographed or videoed. Cultural and religious traditions of
    clothing must be observed where needed.
-   When developing photos, staff must either take them to retail
    outlets or use council equipment in the office. Staff must not
    develop photographic images of children/young people in their own
    home or take videos of children/young people home with them.
-   Staff must not use mobile phones to take pictures of children and
    young people unless there are specific and recorded concerns that
    relate to the likelihood of a child going missing, for example
    during an Home Visit. Once the activity is completed the picture
    must be deleted.
-   Staff must not take any photographic images of children/young people
    to their own home or keep them in their private possession.
-   Photographic images of children/young people should not be displayed
    in places to which members of the public have access. It is
    acknowledged that often children and young people enjoy having their
    photos displayed but displays of images should be confined to areas
    solely used by staff.
-   If photos or videos are to be used for public display e.g. for
    publicity purposes specific permission must be sought from anyone
    with parental responsibility, parents/carers/social workers and from
    the child/young person if appropriate. A separate consent form will
    be used for this particular purpose and children must always be
    dressed in the images. The name of the child/young person in the
    image must never be used.
-   Photographic images of children/young people must never be sent via
    the Internet unless there is parental consent to do so. If this is
    agreed, for example in the context of a potential adoptive
    placement, software to do so must be accessed on work computers.
-   Any images of children whether stored as negative, hard copies or on
    disk must be stored securely.
-   Images of foster children must not be posted on facebook or any
    other social networking internet pages.

## Guidance to foster carers

Whilst you need to be aware of the protocol guiding social workers, we
acknowledge you are in a different situation. Looked after children need
to have a record of their time in foster care with photos being of
particularly importance in recording key events and activities. They may
have big gaps and few photos from other times in their lives. You have a
key responsibility in helping a young person to develop pride in
themselves which can be aided by having a photographic record.

The use of photography should be discussed at placement planning
meetings. The child's social worker should ensure you are aware of any
issues there may be for a child in relation to photography, for example
the possibility of it triggering memories of previous abuse.

Even if there are not specific issues of concern in relation to use of
photography in a child's past, you need to be sensitive to the feelings
of the young person about being photographed or videoed. Obviously
photos should only be taken if a young person is happy for you to do so,
and you must not take photos of a young person unclothed.

You should obtain a photo album for the child placed or establish a
folder on your computer for their photos that could be downloaded on to
a memory stick, CDROM or DVD, or printed off as required for them if
they move on.

Older children should be encouraged and supported to take photos of key
events such as holidays, birthdays, days out and pictures of important
people in their lives.

If you have any queries about this subject please feel free to raise
with your supervising social worker who will give further guidance as
necessary.

Photographs of looked after children must not be posted by carers on
facebook, BeBo, or other internet sites, and looked after children
should be strongly discouraged from doing this as it could place
children at risk of exploitation or abuse, and it could jeopardise the
security of their placement.
