Wholistic Fostering is committed to preventing bullying and promoting a
safe, respectful environment for all children in our care.

This policy supports foster carers and staff to recognise, respond to,
and prevent bullying in line with fostering regulations and National
Minimum Standards (Standard 4).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ❓ What is Bullying?

Bullying is repeated behaviour intended to hurt, intimidate, or distress
another person. It can be:

-   **Emotional** -- exclusion, tormenting, threats
-   **Physical** -- hitting, kicking, pushing
-   **Racist** -- racial taunts or abuse
-   **Sexual** -- unwanted contact or language
-   **Homophobic** -- related to sexuality or identity
-   **Verbal** -- name-calling, sarcasm, teasing
-   **Cyber** -- via phones, social media, or other tech

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚩 Signs a Child May Be Bullied

Adults should watch for warning signs, including:

-   Reluctance or fear about school
-   Change in behaviour or mood (anxious, withdrawn)
-   Sudden drop in school performance
-   Unexplained injuries or missing belongings
-   Sleep or eating problems
-   Aggression or bullying others
-   Avoiding internet or mobile phone use

These may also indicate other issues --- **but bullying must be
considered** and investigated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ Why Looked-After Children May Be More Vulnerable

Children in foster care often face:

-   Past trauma or abuse
-   Low self-esteem or social isolation
-   Frequent school moves
-   Difficulty forming attachments
-   Feeling "different" from peers

These factors may make them **more likely to be victims --- or
perpetrators --- of bullying**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👥 If a Foster Child Is Bullying Others

Bullying may arise from:

-   Being bullied themselves
-   Past abuse or unmet emotional needs
-   Seeking control, status, or attention
-   Poor role models or peer pressure

Work with your [Supervising Social
Worker](internal/supervising_social_worker) and the child's social
worker to:

-   Understand the reasons behind the behaviour
-   Encourage apologies or restorative actions
-   Consider direct work or anger management
-   Involve other professionals if needed
-   Record all incidents and responses
-   Monitor through placement reviews

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛡️ Preventing Bullying

Foster carers should create a home environment that discourages
bullying:

-   Include clear house rules about respectful behaviour
-   Talk openly about bullying and its effects
-   Share books, stories, or creative activities on the topic
-   Model empathy and respectful communication

Your [Safe Caring Policy](policies/safe-caring-policy) should include
your home's strategy for addressing bullying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 If Bullying Occurs

-   Speak with your Supervising Social Worker promptly
-   Keep clear daily records for both the victim and the bully
-   Support both children --- offer empathy and guidance
-   If needed, arrange a meeting to resolve the issue
-   Revisit the child's [Placement Plan](procedures/placement-plans) to
    add prevention strategies

**Persistent or serious bullying** may trigger a:

-   Placement Planning Meeting
-   [Child Protection Referral](procedures/child-protection-referral)
-   [Strategy Discussion/Meeting](procedures/strategy-meeting)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 Notifications and Recording

**Minor bullying** → Notify the Supervising Social Worker as soon as
possible.

**Serious or repeated bullying** → Must be reported immediately to the
Supervising Social Worker, who will notify the child's social worker
within one working day.

All incidents must be recorded in the child's daily records. Regularly
review plans to monitor and reduce risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **In Summary** Everyone involved in a child's life shares
responsibility for preventing bullying. At Wholistic Fostering, we
prioritise respect, care, and open communication --- so that all
children feel safe and valued.
