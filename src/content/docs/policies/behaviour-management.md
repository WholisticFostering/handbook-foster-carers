Wholistic Fostering promotes respectful, consistent, and child-centred
behaviour management in all foster placements. We support children and
young people to understand their behaviour, develop self-regulation
skills, and build positive relationships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Aims

-   Ensure consistent, non-punitive approaches across all foster homes
-   Promote positive behaviour through trust, recognition, and support
-   Respond constructively to challenging behaviour
-   Help children feel safe, valued, and understood

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌱 Core Principles

-   **Respect & Dignity** -- treat every child as an individual with
    worth and voice
-   **Positive Reinforcement** -- reward desired behaviours and growth
-   **Consistency** -- apply approaches fairly and reliably across
    settings
-   **Individualised Responses** -- tailor support to each child's
    background and needs
-   **Constructive, Not Punitive** -- avoid punishment and focus on
    resolution and healing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧰 Proactive Strategies

-   **Clear Expectations** -- agreed upfront and regularly reinforced
-   **Positive Relationships** -- build trust and safety through warm,
    honest engagement
-   **Role Modelling** -- carers model calm, respectful behaviour
-   **Environment** -- create nurturing, low-stress home settings
-   **Open Communication** -- regular check-ins to talk about feelings
    and behaviour

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 Interventions for Challenging Behaviour

-   **Early Intervention** -- act on early signs to prevent escalation
-   **Conflict Resolution** -- use age-appropriate tools to resolve
    disagreements
-   **Time-Out** -- provide calming space when needed, never as
    punishment
-   **Restorative Practice** -- help children take responsibility and
    repair relationships
-   **Support Plans** -- create individual [Behaviour Support
    Plans](resources/forms/behaviour_support_plan) for ongoing needs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👥 Foster Carer Training & Support

-   All carers receive [training](staff/training_programme) on behaviour
    management
-   Supervising social workers provide regular [supervision and
    guidance](staff/staff_supervision)
-   Peer support is encouraged through reflective groups and carer
    forums

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Monitoring & Review

-   Behaviour strategies are regularly reviewed during carer supervision
-   Support plans are updated as children progress or needs change
-   Feedback from carers, children and young people is actively sought

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📢 Complaints & Concerns

-   Children, carers and others can raise concerns via the [Complaints
    Procedure](policies/complaints-representations)
-   All concerns are treated seriously, with a clear and timely response
-   Staff are trained to listen and escalate appropriately when needed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Conclusion** Behaviour is a form of communication. At Wholistic
Fostering, we strive to understand what children are telling us --- and
help them develop safe, constructive ways to express their needs and
feelings.
