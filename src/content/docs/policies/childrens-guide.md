title: Children's Guide
---


Whilst the children and young people can have access to the Statement of
Purpose, it is a lengthy document designed to provide information to
adults. The Children's Guide is more child / young person friendly, and
provides the following:

1.  Information about the home and how it runs;
2.  Where young people can find further information; and
3.  What they can expect from living in the home, including from the
    foster family who will be caring for them.

Each home will provide their own Children's Guide which will be specific
to that particular home. These guides are available for every
child/young person who is accommodated at the home and for any
professionals or parents/carers.

The Children's Guide is regularly reviewed (at least annually) and is
monitored by Ofsted.
