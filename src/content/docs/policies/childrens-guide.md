title: 📘 Children's Guide
---


The Children's Guide is a child-friendly document that helps children
and young people understand what to expect while living in foster care
with Wholistic Fostering.

It is a standalone document --- not a simplified version of the
Statement of Purpose --- and is written in ways that suit the age and
understanding of the children we care for.

## ✨ Two Versions of the Guide

Wholistic Fostering provides **two age-appropriate versions** of the
Children's Guide:

-   📗 **Guide for children aged 5--11**
-   📘 **Guide for young people aged 11--18**

Each version contains the same core information, but the language, tone,
and design are tailored to suit different developmental stages.

## 📚 What the Guide Covers

Both guides explain:

-   🏠 What foster care is and what to expect in a foster home
-   👩‍👩‍👦 Who is responsible for looking after them
-   🙋 Their rights and how they'll be listened to
-   🛟 How to get help or make a complaint
-   ☎️ Who they can contact if they feel worried or unsafe
-   📬 Where they can find out more information

## 📎 Not Home-Specific

The Children's Guide is **not specific to individual foster homes**.
Instead:

-   🏘️ Every foster home has a **Safer Caring Plan** that outlines
    day-to-day expectations specific to that household.
-   📘 The Children's Guide remains consistent across the agency so that
    all children get clear and equal information.

## 🛠️ When and How Children Receive It

All children and young people placed with Wholistic Fostering:

-   Are given a copy of the relevant Children's Guide (based on their
    age) at the start of their placement
-   Go through the guide with their foster carer or social worker
-   Receive it in an alternative format if needed (e.g. visual,
    translated, simplified)

## 🔄 Review and Oversight

-   The Children's Guide is reviewed **at least annually** or whenever
    there are relevant changes to services or support pathways.
-   Its use is monitored by the agency and forms part of Ofsted's
    regulatory oversight.
