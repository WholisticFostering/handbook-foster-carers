title: 🛡️ Child Protection Policy
---


## 📘 Purpose and Scope

This policy outlines how Wholistic Fostering identifies, reports, and
responds to child protection concerns, disclosures, or allegations of
abuse. It applies to all staff, foster carers, and those working with or
on behalf of the agency.

This policy aligns with:

-   Fostering Services National Minimum Standards (2011), Standard 4
-   The Children Act 1989
-   Working Together to Safeguard Children
-   The Sexual Offences Act 2003

## 🌟 Our Principles

-   Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility
-   The child's welfare is paramount
-   Concerns and disclosures are acted upon without delay
-   Children have the right to be heard and protected
-   We work openly with statutory agencies

## 🔍 Recognising Abuse

Abuse includes:

-   **Physical** -- hitting, shaking, burning, etc.
-   **Emotional** -- persistent criticism, threats, rejection
-   **Sexual** -- grooming, exploitation, or coercion
-   **Neglect** -- failing to meet a child's basic needs

See the [Safeguarding Policy](/policies/safeguarding) for full
definitions and indicators.

## 🚨 If You're Worried About a Child

### Immediate Danger

If a child is at immediate risk:

-   Call 999 for police or ambulance
-   Take action to protect the child
-   Notify your Supervising Social Worker (SSW) or Duty Worker ASAP

Do not delay emergency action while seeking advice.

## 📝 Reporting a Concern

### Step 1: Notify Internally

All concerns must be reported to the SSW or Duty Worker immediately.
They will notify the Designated Child Protection Manager (DCPM).

Include:

-   Child's name, DOB, and location
-   Details of the concern, including dates and persons involved
-   Any immediate actions taken

### Step 2: Referral to Authorities

The DCPM may refer to:

-   Local Children's Social Care
-   Police (if a crime is suspected)
-   Ofsted (if required)

All referrals will follow the local safeguarding protocols and be
confirmed in writing.

## 🔐 Sharing Information

Follow these 7 golden rules:

1.  The law supports sharing where children may be at risk
2.  Be open about how and why information may be shared, unless unsafe
3.  Seek advice if unsure
4.  Obtain consent where possible, but share without consent if
    necessary
5.  Base sharing decisions on safety and well-being
6.  Share the right information, with the right people, securely and
    promptly
7.  Keep a clear record of what you shared and why

See the [Confidentiality Policy](/policies/confidentiality) for more.

## ⚠️ Allegations Against Staff or Carers

If an allegation is made **against** a foster carer, staff member, or
volunteer:

-   Do **not** inform the individual
-   Notify the DCPM immediately

    Policy](/policies/allegations-against-staff-and-carers)
