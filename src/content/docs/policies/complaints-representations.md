## - Who Can Make a Complaint?

A child, a parent or carer of a child, a foster carer or anyone else for
whom WF has agreed to provide a service can make a complaint under this
procedure. Individuals are also able to make complaints on behalf of
others if it is considered they have \"sufficient interest\" to do so.

Children will be encouraged to take up issues in the most appropriate
way and they will be supported to do this. If it is possible to identify
a way forward with a complaint which is informal and therefore easily
resolved, this should be the best way forward.

It is the responsibility of WF carers and support staff to help children
to deal with their complaints sympathetically and actively, whether the
complaint is about the agency, or the placing authority.

Anyone making a complaint is also able to withdraw their complaint at
any stage.

## - What Can Be Complained About?

      * A problem
      * The quality of service
      * The delivery or non-delivery of a service including the care or practice of a foster carer
      * The way in which WF carries out its policies and practices.

All serious complaints will be notified to the Regulatory Authority.

If a child or carer is unhappy about a change in their Care Plan or
their Placement Plan this should be brought to the attention of their
social worker who may be able to resolve the matter. If this isn't the
case the child's independent Reviewing Officer may be contacted. It is
the role of the Independent Reviewing Officer to make sure that looked
after children are aware of the local authority's Complaints Procedure,
which must comply with the Children Act 1989 and associated regulations,
and to assist the child to access independent support and advice to
enable them to use this procedure if they wish to do so.

## - Can I get Help to Complain?

Sometimes children and adults need help and support to make a complaint.

The child may have support from his or her parent, social worker,
Independent Visitor or foster carer. As indicated above, a child who
wishes to make a complaint about any aspects of his or her care should
receive assistance to access independent advice and support from their
Independent Reviewing Officer.

Foster carers may enlist the help of a supporter or advocate or their
Supervising Social Worker, as appropriate, to make a complaint about the
agency under this procedure or where appropriate, about the placing
authority under the relevant local authority's complaints procedure.

## - The Complaint Stages

WF is committed to resolving conflicts and concerns at an early stage --
\*\*Stage One \*\*- wherever possible, but in the interests of
transparency and a commitment to individual interests/rights,
individuals are able to complain at \*\*Stage Two \*\* in the first
instance if they so wish. WF will ensure that complainants are kept up
to date regarding the progress of their complaint. In the event that any
complainant is not satisfied at any stage, they may and should avail
themselves of the right to make a complaint to the Regulatory Authority.

### - Stage One

Stage one is an informal process which consists of a meeting between the
complainant and the Fostering Manager. This meeting will be scheduled
once a complaint has been received in writing or recorded by means of
other communication by the Fostering Manager.

Part of this discussion may cover whether it would be more appropriate
for the complaint to be directed to the local authority with
responsibility for the child's placement under the local authority's
complaints procedure.

A letter of resolution or outcome will be issued in response to informal
complaints by the Fostering Manager including details of how the matter
was investigated, by whom and with the relevant facts to support the
outcome.

### - Stage Two

This stage will be activated if the complainant is not completely
satisfied with the outcome of Stage One, or if at the outset they
require that the matter be dealt with by someone other than an employee
of the fostering agency. The complainant will be advised that they must
put their complaint in writing to the Director of WF who will then
contact the complainant within five working days to advise that he/she
has instructed an Independent Complaints Investigating Officer in
relation to the complaint and will advise them of his/her name and the
expected time frame for the investigation.

A report will be completed following the investigation, detailing how
the matter was investigated, by whom and what outcome was reached with
relevant evidence to support the report's conclusions.

### - Stage Three

This is the final stage of the complaints process. If the complainant is
dissatisfied with the outcome of the Stage Two investigation, they must
confirm this in writing, including reasons for their dissatisfaction, to
the Director of WF who will undertake to arrange for the case to be
reviewed by an Independent Panel within 28 days.

The Panel will be made up of:

      * A Fostering Panel member
      * A member of the Board of Directors
      * A manager or staff member of the service
      * An independent individual of such background and experience as required
      * A chairperson if none of the above can fulfil that role

In any event no person implicated in a complaint, or a relative or close
association of theirs may sit on the Panel or be involved in any
investigation, and the Panel will be constituted in such a way to afford
true independent appraisal of the complaint.

The Panel will consider the documentation available in relation to the
complaint and any further written representations that the complainant
wishes to make in relation to the investigation. The Panel will reach a
decision within 24 hours of meeting and the complainant will be advised
of the outcome in report form to include any actions in order to resolve
the situation within 7 days.

Should the complainant still not be satisfied with the outcome of Stage
Three, they may take advice from the Regulatory Authority.

## - Allegations Regarding Standards of Care

This section is concerned with allegations or complaints that foster
carers have fallen below the high standards expected of them: - for
instance, in using physical punishment, treating a child unfairly, or in
any other way failing to promote the welfare or protection of children
for whom they are responsible. This presupposes that a judgement had
already been reached that any physical punishment does not constitute
abuse and does not require a child protection response on the basis of
what is currently known.

### - Investigation

Allegations about standards of care should be dealt with jointly by an
appropriate supervising social worker for the foster carers and by the
social worker for any child involved, as directed by their respective
managers.

Where an investigation is necessary, the foster carer will receive
written notification, including information on:

      * The substance of the allegation;
      * Who will be involved in investigating the allegation;
      * The process and time-scales;
      * Who will be informed or interviewed;
      * The right of the foster carer to independent advice and support throughout the process and details of where this can be obtained;
      * Financial arrangements;
      * Decisions about children currently in the placement and reasons for them;
      * Any temporary variation in the foster carers' terms of approval;
      * Next steps.

The foster carers\' supervising social worker will ensure that the
foster carer has access to appropriate independent support and will seek
to support the carer throughout the process. WF foster carers are able
to access independent support through Foster Talk of which all WF carers
are members of

Where it transpires that a foster carer has, for example, smacked the
child, there needs to be a full discussion with the foster carers\'
supervising social worker and/or the child\'s social worker as to:

      * The circumstances leading up to this event;
      * Why other strategies were not used;
      * Did the foster carers themselves report the incident to staff;
      * The implications of the Foster Care Agreement and this clause in particular - will the carer seek to act within the agreement in future?
      * Any training needs;

Any support needs;

      * Is this child particularly difficult?
      * What strategies will be used in future?

### - Decision Taking

At the conclusion of an investigation:

All standard of care incidents and investigations are taken seriously.
The number of issues that are recorded will be monitored carefully by
the Registered Manager and discussion will take place with the Director
if there are more than 3 recorded incidents involving standards of care
or where the standard of care is deemed to have failed to protect

Those responsible for the welfare of any children involved will need to
consider whether any changes need to be made to their plans;

The foster carers should be informed clearly in writing and by visit of
the outcome of the investigation at this stage, even if further
consideration is necessary, i.e. even if it is only an interim response;

The manager of the Fostering Service needs to consider whether the
carers\' terms of approval should be reviewed under the **Review of
Foster Carers Procedure**. The views of the Fostering Panel should be
sought if appropriate. This decision will be taken by the Fostering
Manager in consultation with colleagues and the Director. Referral to
Panel will depend on the extent or the frequency, of problems, but if
termination is thought to be the appropriate course, an urgent review of
the foster carers should be held and a report must be taken back to
Panel. Consideration should also be given to whether it is appropriate
to refer the foster carer to OFSTED and the \*\*Independent Safeguarding
Authority \*\* under the Vetting and Barring Scheme;

If a decision is taken to review the carers\' approval at the Fostering
Panel, the supervising social worker must complete a report and include
a detailed chronology of all previous allegations, complaints or
standards of care issues together with details of actions taken and the
outcome. The report must also include a chronology of previous
placements and any training undertaken by the carers. The report must be
signed by the supervising social worker and the Manager.

If the matter is considered by the Fostering Panel, the foster carers
should be advised of the outcome of the Panel process in writing and
their right of representation and to appeal against the decision made
(including to the Independent Review panel as set out in the Review of
Foster Carers Procedure).

Following a review of a foster carer\'s suitability to foster as a
result of an allegation or serious concern, the agency should review the
circumstances of the case and the way any investigation was conducted to
determine whether there are any improvements to be made in their
procedures or practice.

## - Termination of approval

In all cases, the Service Manager for Placements must be contacted, who
will make the decision whether to suspend the carer\'s status during the
investigation. This in turn will be marked on the Foster Carers\'
Register.

If the investigation then identifies serious concerns and/or unanswered
questions about either the carer, or their care of a child, then further
specialist assessments may be carried out. A report must be prepared for
Panel who will make a recommendation about the carer\'s future
registration.

The Agency Decision Maker will make the final decision. If consideration
is being given to ending the approval for a carer, because of child care
concerns, then they will be notified and offered representation and a
meeting with the Placement Service Manager. Carers who have their
approval terminated for child protection/standards of care will be
notified in writing and offered 28 days to appeal against any decision
made. Disagreements between the Agency Decision Maker and the Placement
Service Manager will be referred to the Head of Service, who will make
the final decision.

Carers should be aware that termination of approval resulting from a
child protection investigation or standards of care could well result in
a referral to the \*\*Independent Safeguarding Authority \*\* for
inclusion on the Children\'s Barred List

## - Resigning during the course of an investigation

Resignation should not prevent an allegation being followed up and a
conclusion should be reached and recorded.

If the foster carer resigns before or during an investigation, the
manager of the Fostering Service will immediately notify the senior
manager/s in the local authorities responsible for all the children
involved.

A report will be considered by the Fostering Panel, including where
necessary a recommendation for referral to the \*\*Independent
Safeguarding Authority \*\* (ISA) for inclusion on the Children\'s
Barred List. Panel will submit a recommendation to the Agency Decision
Maker. The OFSTED should be informed of any decision to refer a carer to
the ISA.

Where a foster carer wishes to transfer to another fostering provider
during the course of an investigation, the foster carer\'s current
provider will notify the other fostering agency that the foster carer is
subject to investigation/review of approval.

## - Financial implications for Foster Carers

The payments and allowances received by a foster carer may be affected
by an allegation. The Fostering Service will confirm in writing the
details of financial support available to carers where children have
been removed or who are suspended from taking further placements.

It is understood that there may be an occasion(s) when an allegation is
made about a foster carer that is without foundation. In this event, the
agency (or placing authority) will have undertaken its own investigation
and have been satisfied the foster carer had acted entirely
appropriately. If the fostered child(ren) remained in the care of the
carer whilst the investigation had taken place, the payments to the
carer will continue as usual.

If the allegation involved a safeguarding concern and the placing
authority removed the child(ren) from the foster carer, or the carer had
been suspended by the agency, then payments to the carer will cease
immediately the child(ren) left the placement.

The agency will undertake its own review of the placement. There may
also be an investigation carried out by the police and/or social
worker.It is envisaged that all investigations should be completed
within 6 months and in most cases within a shorter time frame.

The letter terminating a foster carer\'s approval should also confirm
when payments will cease.

Arrangements for paying foster carers in the event of an allegation or
serious concern should be set out in the foster carers\' handbook and
confirmed in writing to the foster carer if they are suspended from
taking further placements.
