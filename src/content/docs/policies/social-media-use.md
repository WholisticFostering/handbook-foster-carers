title: 🌐 Social Media Use (Facebook & Beyond)
---


## 🎯 Purpose

This policy supports safe, responsible social media use by foster carers
and household members. It protects the privacy and wellbeing of children
in our care, while recognising that social media is part of daily life.

## 🚫 What NOT to Share

Carers and family members **must not** share:

-   📸 Photos of any looked after child
-   📍 Location info or check-ins relating to placements
-   🎉 Details of events, trips or holidays involving looked after
    children
-   🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Names, initials or other identifying details
-   📖 Posts referring to yourself as a foster carer or discussing
    placements

## 🔐 Your Profile Settings

-   Set all social media accounts to **private ('Friends Only')**
-   Turn off **location tagging** on photos and posts
-   Approve all tags before they appear on your profile
-   Regularly review who can see your content and unfriend/block if
    needed
-   Talk to your own children and visitors about keeping things private

## 🧒 Children & Young People\'s Online Activity

If children in your care use social media:

-   Monitor use sensitively --- check who they talk to and what they
    share
-   Encourage open conversation about online risks
-   Help them adjust settings for privacy and safety
-   Watch for signs of grooming, bullying, or distress
-   Complete a [Digital Family Safe Care
    Agreement](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/digital-family-safe-care-agreement/)

## 📣 If You Have Concerns

If you see or suspect online harm:

-   Talk to the child (if appropriate)
-   Notify your **Supervising Social Worker**
-   You may also need to inform the **child's Social Worker**
-   Report serious concerns to CEOP:
    [www.ceop.police.uk](https://www.ceop.police.uk)

Do **not** confront anyone directly or take screenshots of illegal
material --- report it through official channels.

## 💬 Balancing Freedom & Safety

Social media can be positive when used wisely. As a carer:

-   Be a **role model** in how you behave online
-   Balance supervision with the child's right to some privacy
-   Use social media as a way to understand their world and interests
