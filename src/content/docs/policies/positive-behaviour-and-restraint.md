lastUpdated: 2025-07-17

## 🎯 Purpose

This policy guides foster carers and staff in supporting positive
behaviour in children and young people, and outlines how to safely
manage incidents involving discipline or restraint when absolutely
necessary.

It is based on the National Minimum Standards for Fostering (Standard 3)
and the Fostering Services Regulations 2011.

## 🌱 Our Approach to Behaviour

We believe that positive relationships, understanding individual needs,
and creating a stable, caring environment are the keys to encouraging
good behaviour.

Foster carers are expected to:

-   Create a nurturing, calm and consistent household
-   Set clear, age-appropriate boundaries
-   Encourage positive choices through praise and rewards
-   Help children understand and take responsibility for their actions

## 👍 Encouragement and Reward

Carers should use everyday opportunities to:

-   Praise effort and achievements
-   Use reward systems where helpful (e.g. stickers, extra privileges)
-   Encourage participation in positive activities
-   Teach conflict resolution and emotional regulation

## 🚫 Unacceptable Sanctions

The following are strictly not permitted:

-   Physical punishment (e.g. smacking, shaking)
-   Deprivation of food, drink, sleep or contact
-   Humiliation, ridicule or emotional abuse
-   Locking a child in a room or restricting movement without consent
-   Threats of removal from placement as punishment

Sanctions should always be:

-   Proportionate and appropriate to the child's understanding
-   Aimed at helping the child learn and grow
-   Logged and reviewed with your supervising social worker

## 🤝 Supporting Positive Behaviour

We recognise some children have experienced trauma and may need
additional help. Foster carers will:

-   Work closely with their supervising social worker and the child's
    social worker
-   Take part in behaviour support planning
-   Use de-escalation techniques before any sanction is considered

## 🛑 Physical Intervention & Restraint

Physical restraint is only used:

-   As a last resort
-   When a child is at immediate risk of harming themselves or others
-   To prevent serious damage to property

If restraint is used:

-   It must be reasonable, proportionate and the minimum necessary
-   It must be reported immediately to the supervising social worker
-   A written report must be completed and reviewed

Foster carers will receive training on behaviour management and safe
holding techniques where required.

## 📝 Recording and Oversight

Any use of restraint or serious behavioural incidents must be recorded
and shared with:

-   Your supervising social worker
-   The child's social worker
-   Senior management if required

This helps ensure transparency and safety for all involved.

## 🎓 Training and Support

All foster carers are offered training in:

-   Managing behaviour positively
-   Understanding trauma and attachment
-   De-escalation and conflict resolution

Further training is arranged for carers supporting children with complex
emotional or behavioural needs.

## 🔁 Reviews and Supervision

Behavioural concerns and strategies are reviewed:

-   During regular supervision sessions
-   As part of the child's care and placement planning
-   At the carer's annual review

boundaries and support systems in place when behaviours become
challenging.

of the way.
