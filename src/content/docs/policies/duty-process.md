## Placement referrals

Wholistic Fostering has a clear Duty process which is to be followed at
all times.

### Process and procedure:

      * The Info email will bleep when a new email arrives, but the email should be checked every 10 minutes regardless.
      * Check each referral carefully and consider if we able to offer a potential match – the vacancy list has the profiles of each foster carer to use as a guide and the matching tool will help identify a potential match
      * If a potential match cannot be offered record the referral on the referral log and respond to the local authority informing them of t his
      * If the duty worker feels that a potential match could be offered then the following actions should be taken – enter the referral onto the duty log

      - Discuss match with the foster carers supervising social worker and one of the managers
      - Contact the foster carer to discuss the referral and seek their views. Record the reason for any refusal on the form called referral considered for carers and file this on the duty file
      - If potential match is agreed with the foster carer and the Duty Manager then complete the matching document
      - Email foster carers Form F and latest annual review along with the matching document to the Local Authority’s placement team
      - If the LA have not responded in one hour then follow up with an email or phone call
      - At the end of the process regardless if a placement has been agreed ensure that all relevant information is logged on the referral log, including outcome and name of Duty Social Worker

      * If LA accepts match then complete the referral form and risk assessment.
      * Send the placing authority the foster carer’s LA check, NSPCC check, back page of the medical, CRB declaration and health and Safety check along with any other documents they may require
      * Print off referral and email and put this with the referral form – these will eventually be placed on the child’s file
      * For work that is completed when making a match and arranging a placement place the recording on the foster carers file
      * The Duty worker must be available to make the placement if the supervising social worker is not able to do so – new placement documents should be completed (these are located in the duty folder on the desktop)
      * Record all actions that are taken when trying to make a match. If there is anything that needs following up the next day place the recording and actions required in the work pending file.
      * The completed duty log is located on the shared the Drive. It is important that this is kept up to date so that the information can be used for the monthly report that goes to the Directors.

## Other duties

      * The Duty worker should deal with all phone calls from foster carers if the supervising social worker is not available – this contact must be recorded and the supervising social worker advised of this contact as soon as possible. The write up should be placed on the foster carers file
      * The Duty worker should be prepared to visit a foster carer if a crisis occurs and if the supervising social worker or fostering support worker is unable to do so
