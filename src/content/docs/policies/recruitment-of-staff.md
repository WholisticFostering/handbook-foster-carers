---


The safe recruitment of staff is the first step to safeguarding and
promoting the welfare of our children. Wholistic Fostering is committed
to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people
and expects all staff and volunteers to share this commitment. This is
to be achieved through effective recruitment and retention of competent,
motivated staff members who are suited to, and competent in their roles.

Wholistic Fostering recognises the value of, and seeks to achieve a
diverse workforce comprising different backgrounds, skills and
abilities. As such it is committed to a recruitment and selection
process which is systematic, efficient, effective and equal. In doing
so, it upholds its obligations under law and national collective
agreements to not discriminate against applicants on grounds of age,
sex, sexual orientation or identity, marital status, disability, race,
colour, nationality, ethnic origin, religion or creed.

Introduction The purpose of this policy is to ensure the practice of
safe recruitment of staff appointed to Wholistic Fostering. It also sets
out the minimum requirements to:

      * attract the best possible applicants to vacancies;
      * deter prospective applicants unsuitable for work with children and;
      * identify and reject applicants unsuitable for work with children

Practices

The following procedures and practices are in place to ensure the safe
recruitment of staff.

# Stage 1:

Advertising and Inviting Applications

All advertisements for all posts will clearly stipulate the stance
adopted by Wholistic Fostering by the inclusion of the following
statement:

"The Directors of Wholistic Fostering are committed to safeguarding and
promoting the welfare of children and applicants must be willing to
undergo child protection screening appropriate to the post, including
checks with past employers and the Disclosure and Barring Service"

# Stage 2:

Pre -Application Pack Prospective applicants are supplied with the
following:

      * Online Application Form – that includes a self-disclosure section; link provided here ([[http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/employee-forms/wfem01-employee-application-form/|http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/employee-forms/wfem01-employee-application-form/]])
      * Online DBS-Enhanced disclosure ( if you are not on the DBS Update Service a link will be sent out to you for access. If you are on the DBS Update Service then your original certificate relating to you update account should also be provide prior to your interview)
      * Wholistic Fostering Statement of Purpose;
      * Job description;
      * Safer Recruitment Policy;

All applicants must complete the online application form in full.

# Stage 3

Applicant Selection/ Short-Listing

All applications received will be scrutinized in a systematic way by the
short-listing panel and candidates deemed suitable for the post will be
short-listed following consultation between the Managers leading the
recruitment process and other relevant staff process.

Telephone interviews may be used at the short-listing stage to establish
suitability for interview but will not be a substitute for a
face-to-face meeting as part of the final selection/interview process.
Where possible, references are taken up before the interview stage.

However should a candidate progress to selection and interview stage
prior to their receipt, satisfactory references will always be taken up
prior to any appointment being made.

# Stage 4

Interview

Prior to embarking on the interview process and on point of arrival,
candidates selected for interview will have to provide:

      * photographic proof of identity (Passport, Current Driving Licences, Birth Certificate)
      * actual certificates of qualifications (verification of professional status etc. Hcpc registration number)
      * eligibility to live and work in the UK
      * two formal documentation of your current address.(Bank statement, Council tax letter, Medical card, Utilities Bill, Gas, Electricity or Water)
      * two references that can be contacted

The interview process will seek to assess candidates in terms of whether
their appointment would be in line with safer recruitment and fulfill
the requirements of the post.

A competency-based interview will be conducted with evidence gathered
against both the technical and behavioral competencies that are most
relevant for that post.

Significantly, in terms of safer recruitment practices, at least one
representative involved in the interview process, will have successfully
completed safer recruitment training and there will be one further
interviewer present to watch the responses given by the applicant when
asked probing safer recruitment interview questions.

Candidates will always be required to:

      * explain satisfactorily any gaps in employment or significant periods of time working or living abroad;
      * explain satisfactorily any anomalies or discrepancies in the information available to the interviewers;
      * declare any information that is likely to appear on an Enhanced DBS disclosure;
      * demonstrate their capacity to safeguard and protect the welfare of children and young people.

# Stage 5

References

References are sought directly from the referee. References or
testimonials provided by the candidate are never accepted. Open
references 'To whom it may concern' and so on will not be accepted if
they fail to include date evidence or are without obvious organisation
authorisation.

In all cases where applicants are invited to interview, referees will be
contacted by telephone or e-mail in order to clarify any anomalies or
discrepancies. A detailed written note will be kept of such exchanges
and retained on the personnel file of the individual appointed.

Furthermore, previous employers who have not been named as referees will
be contacted in order to clarify any anomalies or discrepancies and
again a detailed written note of such exchanges will be retained on the
personnel file of the individual appointed.

# Stage 6

Successful Candidate Pre Employment Checks

Further to those checks at the point of interview the candidate will be
required to provide all of the following prior to taking up the post
being undertaken:

      * • receipt of at least two satisfactory references;
      * • verification of the candidate’s identity;
      * • a satisfactory Enhanced DBS disclosure;
      * • verification of qualifications;
      * • verification of professional status where required e.g. HCPC registration,
      * • the production of evidence of the right to work in the UK.

The manager responsible for the recruitment of a new member of staff
will ensure that the recruitment check-list is filled in and returned on
the new employee's file.

# Rehabilitation of Offenders Disclosure

The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA) was revised following
implementation of change to the ROA included in the Legal Aid and
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. As of May 2013,
amendments made to the Exceptions Order of the ROA resulted in certain
old and minor cautions and spent convictions not being subject to
disclosure or appearing on a standard or enhanced DBS disclosure
certificate.

As such, Wholistic Fostering has added the following wording to all its
application forms:

"The appointment of any staff member who may have contact with or access
to children or vulnerable adults will be subject to the receipt of a
satisfactory DBS check Because of the nature of the work this post is
exempted from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and all
convictions both spent and unspent must be disclosed."

Upfront disclosure of a criminal record may not debar you from
appointment as we shall consider the nature of the offence, how long ago
and at what age it was committed and any other relevant factors.

Please submit information in confidence enclosing details in a separate
sealed envelope which will be seen and then destroyed by the HR team. If
you would like to discuss this beforehand, please telephone in
confidence to the HR team for advice.

Please disclose any unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands or
warnings. Please note that the amendments to the Exceptions Order 1975
(2013) provide that certain spent convictions and cautions are
'protected' and are not subject to disclosure to employers, and cannot
be taken into account. Guidance and criteria on the filtering of these
cautions and convictions can be found at the Disclosure and Barring
Service website.

Failure to declare any convictions (that not subject to DBS filtering)
may disqualify you for appointment or result in summary dismissal if the
discrepancy comes to light subsequently.

# Data Protection

Issues Employees are entitled to see and receive, if requested, copies
of their employment references. Further disclosed information will be
treated in confidence and not used against applicants unfairly,
including adherence to the DBS Code of Practice
