Wholistic Fostering is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and
empowering environment for all children, carers, staff and stakeholders.
This policy outlines our approach to promoting equality, celebrating
diversity, and ensuring inclusive practices across all aspects of our
work.

## 🎯 Our Vision and Mission

Wholistic Fostering was founded with a mission to improve outcomes for
children and young people of African and Caribbean heritage, who have
historically experienced poorer outcomes in the care system. We strive
to offer identity-affirming, culturally competent care that recognises
and responds to the unique needs of each child.

We are equally committed to ensuring that every child, regardless of
background, is valued, respected and given every opportunity to thrive.

## ⚖️ Legal and Regulatory Framework

We uphold the Equality Act 2010 and are committed to meeting all
relevant legislation and standards, including:

The Human Rights Act 1998

The Children Act 1989

The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011

The National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services

These frameworks guide us in eliminating unlawful discrimination and
promoting equal opportunity in every aspect of our work.

## 🧭 Principles

All individuals will be treated with dignity and respect.

We proactively challenge discrimination, harassment, and inequality.

Our policies and practices are shaped by the lived experiences of those
we serve.

We promote equal access and participation for everyone.

We celebrate difference and build on diversity as a strength.

## 💡 Positive Action

As part of our mission, we may take lawful positive action under Section
158 of the Equality Act 2010 to address underrepresentation or
disadvantage.

This includes targeted recruitment, outreach, and tailored training to
ensure carers are equipped to meet the cultural, emotional and identity
needs of African and Caribbean children in care.

This is done in a way that complements our broader commitment to
diversity and fairness, not at its expense.

## 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Staff and Foster Carers

We expect all staff and foster carers to actively uphold the principles
of this policy. We:

Recruit carers and staff from all backgrounds who are committed to
inclusive and culturally responsive care.

Provide training in anti-discriminatory practice, cultural competence,
and unconscious bias.

Expect all team members to act when they witness discriminatory
behaviour.

## 👦🏾 Children and Young People

We are committed to:

Providing care that supports children to understand, celebrate and feel
pride in their heritage.

Ensuring access to diverse role models and support networks.

Listening to children's experiences of identity, difference, and
belonging.

Helping all children feel seen, safe and supported.

## 🧾 Monitoring and Review

We regularly monitor the diversity of our carers, staff, and service
users to ensure our services reflect the communities we serve.

We review this policy at least annually and in consultation with staff,
carers, and young people.

Breaches of this policy may result in disciplinary action.
