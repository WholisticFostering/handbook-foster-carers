---
====== 🚨 Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Policy & Strategy ======

===== 🎯 Purpose =====
To define child sexual exploitation (CSE), outline how Wholistic Fostering responds to suspected or known cases, and support carers and staff in safeguarding children at risk of CSE.

===== 📚 Legal Framework =====
Compliant with:
  * Children Acts 1989 & 2004
  * Fostering Services Regulations 2011
  * Working Together to Safeguard Children
  * National Action Plan to Tackle CSE

===== 🧠 What is CSE? =====
Child Sexual Exploitation is a form of child sexual abuse. It involves exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people receive something—like attention, gifts, or accommodation—in exchange for sexual activity. Consent is never valid in these circumstances.

===== 🚩 Signs & Risk Indicators =====
Key signs a child may be at risk of CSE include:
  * Going missing or staying out late
  * Unexplained gifts or money
  * Associating with older individuals
  * Changes in behaviour, mood or school attendance
  * Sexual health concerns
  * Use of alcohol or drugs
  * Online activity linked to adult strangers

===== 🧭 Roles & Responsibilities =====

**Foster Carers**
  * Immediately report concerns to the child’s social worker and supervising social worker.
  * Support children through open, non-judgmental communication.
  * Implement safe care agreements and online safety strategies.

**Supervising Social Workers**
  * Record and escalate concerns immediately (within 24 hours).
  * Inform local authority safeguarding teams.
  * Support carers and coordinate any necessary risk assessments or referrals.

===== 🔄 Multi-Agency Action Plan =====
  * Concerns should trigger a Multi-Agency Planning (MAP) meeting.
  * Risk categories:
    * **At Risk (1)** – vulnerable, early warning signs
    * **Medium Risk (2)** – involvement suspected or beginning
    * **High Risk (3)** – ongoing exploitation

  * Plans must focus on early intervention, harm reduction, and safeguarding strategies.

===== 🔐 Internet & Tech-Safety =====
Technology is a known method of grooming. Carers must:
  * Use our [[policies:health_and_safety_foster_carers_homes|Internet and Mobile Phone Policy]]
  * Complete a [[http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/digital-family-safe-care-agreement/|Digital Safe Care Agreement]] with the child

===== ⚠️ Emergency Response =====
If immediate danger is suspected:
  * Call 999
  * Confiscate harmful material (if safe)
  * Ensure child safety
  * Seek medical attention if needed
  * Record and report

===== 🧠 Awareness & Training =====
Wholistic Fostering provides carers with training on:
  * Recognising grooming and exploitation
  * Responding safely and appropriately
  * Using tools like risk frameworks and safe care plans
