title: 🚨 Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Policy & Strategy
---


## 🎯 Purpose

To define child sexual exploitation (CSE), outline how Wholistic
Fostering responds to suspected or known cases, and support carers and
staff in safeguarding children at risk of CSE.

## 📚 Legal Framework

Compliant with:

-   Children Acts 1989 & 2004
-   Fostering Services Regulations 2011
-   Working Together to Safeguard Children
-   National Action Plan to Tackle CSE

## 🧠 What is CSE?

Child Sexual Exploitation is a form of child sexual abuse. It involves
exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people
receive something---like attention, gifts, or accommodation---in
exchange for sexual activity. Consent is never valid in these
circumstances.

## 🚩 Signs & Risk Indicators

Key signs a child may be at risk of CSE include:

-   Going missing or staying out late
-   Unexplained gifts or money
-   Associating with older individuals
-   Changes in behaviour, mood or school attendance
-   Sexual health concerns
-   Use of alcohol or drugs
-   Online activity linked to adult strangers

## 🧭 Roles & Responsibilities

**Foster Carers**

-   Immediately report concerns to the child's social worker and
    supervising social worker.
-   Support children through open, non-judgmental communication.
-   Implement safe care agreements and online safety strategies.

**Supervising Social Workers**

-   Record and escalate concerns immediately (within 24 hours).
-   Inform local authority safeguarding teams.
-   Support carers and coordinate any necessary risk assessments or
    referrals.

## 🔄 Multi-Agency Action Plan

-   Concerns should trigger a Multi-Agency Planning (MAP) meeting.
-   Risk categories:
    -   **At Risk (1)** -- vulnerable, early warning signs
    -   **Medium Risk (2)** -- involvement suspected or beginning
    -   **High Risk (3)** -- ongoing exploitation

-   Plans must focus on early intervention, harm reduction, and
    safeguarding strategies.

-   Complete a [Digital Safe Care
    Agreement](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/digital-family-safe-care-agreement/)
    with the child

## ⚠️ Emergency Response

If immediate danger is suspected:

-   Call 999
