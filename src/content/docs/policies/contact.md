description: Contact with Parents, Siblings & Social Visits
---


This policy explains how contact with birth families, relatives and
friends should be arranged, supported and reviewed for children living
with Wholistic foster carers.

## 📜 Scope

This policy is compliant with the Fostering Services (England)
Regulations and National Minimum Standards (2011), particularly:

-   **Standard 9** -- Promoting and Supporting Contact

It covers:

-   Contact with parents and siblings
-   Supervised and unsupervised contact
-   Social visits (including overnight stays) with relatives or friends

## 🤝 Contact with Parents and Siblings

Children should be supported to **maintain safe and appropriate
contact** with their family when it's in their best interest and
consistent with their Care Plan.

Contact arrangements must be:

-   **Approved** by the child's social worker
-   **Clearly recorded** in the Placement Plan
-   **Reviewed regularly** at Looked After Reviews

Contact must **never be withdrawn as a sanction** for behaviour.

### 🧍 Unsupervised Contact

Can only happen if:

-   Agreed in advance by the placing authority
-   Detailed in the Placement Plan

### 👀 Supervised Contact

Where supervision is required, the Placement Plan must explain:

-   Who will supervise
-   What level of supervision is needed
-   Where contact can take place
-   How it will be recorded

Supervisors must **follow guidance** in the plan and record their
observations promptly.

### 🏠 Foster Carers Visiting Family Homes

If foster carers are asked to supervise or attend family contact:

-   They must speak to their **supervising social worker first**
-   A **risk assessment** must be completed
-   If at any point the safety of the carer or child is at risk, they
    should **leave and report immediately**

### 🚩 Concerns During Contact

Any concerns should be:

-   Reported to the child's social worker
-   Recorded clearly

In an **emergency**, foster carers may stop contact if necessary to
protect the child. They must notify:

-   Their **supervising social worker**
-   The **child's social worker** within 24 hours

## 🏡 Social Visits & Overnight Stays with Relatives and Friends

Children should be supported to take part in **normal, age-appropriate
social activities** such as:

-   Sleepovers with friends
-   Weekend trips with other families
-   Occasional childcare by trusted adults
-   School trips

These should be treated **like they would for any other child**, unless
there's a specific risk or restriction.

### ✅ When Is Permission Needed?

The Placement Plan should say:

-   If foster carers can agree to overnight stays without asking the
    social worker
-   Whether parental consent is required

### 📝 Factors to Consider Before Agreeing

Foster carers should assess:

-   Are there any **restrictions** in the Placement Plan?
-   Any **concerns or risks** in the proposed household?
-   Is the stay with a **child/peer**, not just an adult?
-   Is the **child's age and understanding** appropriate?
-   Is it clear **whose idea** the stay was?
-   Does the child **know and trust** the people involved?

### 🧭 Practical Checks

Before agreeing, carers should confirm:

-   Who is supervising and where the child will stay
-   Return arrangements and contact numbers
-   That the child knows how to **get in touch or ask to come home**
-   Whether the child has a **mobile phone or contact number**

### 🧾 Information Sharing

Only **essential information** should be shared with other adults (on a
need-to-know basis), such as:

-   Health needs
-   Behaviour strategies
-   Routines

If a child refuses to share this information, they should be told this
may affect whether the visit goes ahead.

### 🧍 If the Visit Goes Ahead

The carer must:

-   Record the arrangements and decision in their daily record
-   Inform the child's social worker **as soon as possible**
-   Discuss any feedback or concerns raised after the visit

## ⚠️ Concerns After Social Contact

If a child appears upset or anxious after visiting relatives or friends:

-   The concern should be **shared with the social worker**
-   This should be **recorded**
-   Contact arrangements may need to be **reviewed**
