Contact with Parents/Siblings and Social Visits/Overnight Stays with
Relatives and Friends

## Scope

This chapter explains the arrangements that need to be in place in
relation to the contact that children placed with agency foster carers
have with parents and siblings, as well as social visits (including
overnight stays) to other relatives and friends.

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 9 Promoting and Supporting
Contact.

## Contact with Parents and Siblings

Wherever possible and appropriate, children should be encouraged and
supported to maintain contact with their parents and siblings, and
parents and siblings should be encouraged to take part in activities
organised for their children. Such contacts should be consistent with
the child\'s Care Plan; which, itself, must take account of any Child
Protection Plan or Contact Order that may be in force.

Contact between children and parents or siblings may only be permitted
if previously agreed by the child's social worker and set out in the
child\'s Placement Agreement/Placement Plan.

Both direct and indirect contact arrangements should always be clearly
detailed setting out the purpose, how contact will take place, the venue
(or type of meeting place), the frequency and how the arrangements will
be evaluated and reviewed.

Contact arrangements must not be withdrawn as a sanction imposed on a
child.

### Unsupervised Contact

Children may only have unsupervised contact with parents and siblings
with the agreement of the Placing Authority and where the arrangements
for such contact are set out in the Placement Agreement/Placement Plan.

### Supervised Contact

The decision about the need for supervised contact will be made by the
Placing Authority as part of the assessment and planning process, the
reasons should be clearly recorded and the arrangements set out in the
child\'s Placement Agreement/Placement Plan, which will be regularly
reviewed as a minimum at the Looked After Review.

The arrangements will include the details about the role of the
supervisor, the extent of the supervision required (it may be sufficient
to supervise from an adjacent room) and if the visit is confined to a
certain identified area, for example a specified contact centre.

Those supervising such visits should familiarise themselves with the
requirements as detailed in the Placement Agreement, follow the
requirements specified and fully record their observations as soon as
possible after the contact visit takes place.

### Foster Carers Visiting Family Homes

If it is likely that foster carer(s) will visit children or supervise
them in the family homes, they must consult their Supervising Social
Worker beforehand - and a risk assessment should be completed. Advice
should be provided to the foster carer on any risks and strategies they
should adopt.

If foster carers are confronted with unacceptable behaviour during the
visit, they should attempt to comply with the guidance provided by their
Supervising Social Worker, but if they consider that they and/or the
child are at significant risk, they should leave, preferably with the
child, and contact their Supervising Social Worker in the first instance
and the child's social worker.

### Concerns during Contact

Whenever the foster carers and/or the fostering agency's staff are
concerned about a child's reaction to contact, this will be communicated
to the child's social worker and the discussion will be recorded.

Should foster carers or other agency staff have any concerns during
contact and consider that immediate action is required, they should take
what reasonable steps they can to reduce or prevent any risk -- wherever
possible this action should be taken by a foster carer after first
consulting their Supervising Social Worker or by other agency staff
after consulting their line manager. In exceptional circumstances, they
should notify the Police.

Emergency restrictions on contact can only be made by the agency to
protect the child from significant risk and must be notified to the
placing authority (child's social worker) within 24 hours.

### Restrictions or Termination of Contact

As stated above, contact should always be agreed with the Placing
Authority and no restrictions on contact should be made by the foster
carers without the agreement of the child's social worker. The only
exception to this is in an emergency situation where the foster carer or
a member of staff within the agency reasonably believes that they need
to safeguard or promote the welfare of the child; if foster carers takes
any such action, they must notify their Supervising Social Worker and
the child's social worker immediately afterwards.

## Social Visits (including Overnight Stays) with Relatives and Friends

When the child\'s placement is made, information regarding existing
relationships with relatives and friends and the approach to the child
continuing to have social visits to and with them, as well as visits
involving friends and family of the foster carers and new friends who
the child meets when in the foster placement, should be obtained from
the child's social worker. The child's parents\' views on such contact
should also be obtained.

Arrangements for such contact (including overnight stays) should be set
out in the Placement Agreement/Placement Plan. This will include the
parameters within which visits or stays away from the foster home may be
agreed by the foster carer without prior consultation with the child's
social worker, and whether before giving agreement to such visits the
foster carer is required to obtain parental consent.

The circumstances in which these situations may arise include the
following:

      - Sleepovers with friends
      - Invitations to go out for the day with a friend’s family where the family are unlikely to be back until late
      - Invitations to join a friend’s family who are going away for a weekend
      - The foster carer’s own children going to a relative or friend for up to 4 days and the child wishing to go as well.
      - A relative or friend of the foster family occasionally acting as baby-sitter where the usual arrangements have broken down or are not available
      - School trips of up to 4 days away
      - A child’s authorised day visit with a friend or family being extended if the child cannot return due to bad weather or a car breaking down where there are no known restrictions to an overnight stay taking place

It is important that, unless there is a specific reason why contacts or
overnight stays should not take place (for example the child has harmed
other children and they may still pose a risk) looked after children
should be given the same permission to take part in normal and
acceptable age appropriate activities, such as staying over with
friends, as any child would.

Where there are exceptional reasons to require foster carers to seek the
permission of the child's social worker, a manager or a parent, or place
specific restrictions on permitting a child to stay overnight with
friends, this should be because of reasons necessary to safeguard the
child's welfare. If there is such a reason, the required arrangements
should then be appropriately recorded including whether there is a need
for CRB checks on the people involved in the contact, and these should
be explained to the child.

Foster carers considering a request from a child to stay overnight with
a friend should base their decision on the following factors:

      - Are there any relevant restrictions in the child’s Placement Agreement/Placement Plan?
      - Are there any factors in the child’s past experiences or behaviour to preclude overnight stays?
      - Are there any grounds for concern that the child may be at significant risk in the household concerned or from the activities proposed?
      - Is the child staying with another child or children, rather than staying solely with an adult?
      - The age and level of understanding of the child.
      - What is the purpose and length of the overnight stay?
      - Whose idea was the overnight stay?
      - How well is the friend or family known to the child?

The arrangements for supervising or caring for the child must not
compromise the safety of the child or of anyone else; and the following
considerations should apply:

      - Have the arrangements been confirmed with the parent of the friend or the adult who will have responsibility during the visit?
      - Is the address of where the child be staying known
      - What are the arrangements for the child returning to the home?
      - Is there a contact number for the household in which the child will stay?
      - Is the child aware of what to do if he or she wants to return to the home earlier than planned?
      - Does the child have a contact number for the carers where they can be reached at any time?
      - Does the child have access to a mobile phone?

In all cases, discussions should be held with the child, dependent on
his or her age, as to what, if any, information should be shared with
other adults to enable them to look after the child appropriately.

This might include:

      * Any specific health care needs of the child
      * Any established routines for the child
      * Any behaviour management problems which, if the adult is unaware of, could lead to difficulties during the visit, for example the child may be over familiar with adults or over assertive with younger children

Any decision to share information should be on a 'need to know' basis
and recorded. If the child refuses to allow appropriate information to
be shared, then he or she needs to be made aware that this could affect
the decision to allow the child to stay away from home.

If satisfied that it is appropriate to allow the child's stay away, a
decision to allow it to go ahead may be made. If not, it may not be
allowed. The decision and the arrangements agreed should be recorded in
full in the carers daily record.

Even if it has been agreed that the social worker does not have to be
consulted in making these arrangements, s/he must still be informed as
soon as practicable afterwards and the social worker should inform the
parents as appropriate.

Whenever the foster carers and/or the fostering agency's staff are
concerned about a child's reaction to contact with relatives and
friends, this will be communicated to the child's social worker, the
discussion will be recorded and the need to review the arrangements will
be considered.
