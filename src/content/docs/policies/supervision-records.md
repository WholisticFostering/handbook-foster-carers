The recording of supervision sessions is the responsibility of the
supervisor, who must adhere to the following standards of recording.
This will be checked during the quality assurance process.

      * The detail included in the supervision record is a matter of judgement for the supervisor. In general the record should be detailed enough so that the issue can be revisited at a later date and still be understood. A short summary should be sufficient in most cases;
      * Where possible supervision records should be typed. Handwritten notes are permissible providing the supervisor's writing is legible; this will form part of the Supervision Agreement;
      * Supervisors should aim to give a copy of the record to the supervisee for signature within one week. This should form part of the Supervision Agreement;
      * Records should clearly detail any decisions that have been made and the reasons for these, any agreed actions including timescales where appropriate, and who will take responsibility;
      * The records should be signed and dated and a copy kept by both parties. If there is a disagreement as to the content of the record this should be recorded by the supervisor with an indication as to how the matter can be resolved with a specified timescale;
      * Whilst it is recognised that many staff prefer to keep records on computer systems, in the case of supervision records hard copies must be taken, to both safeguard the supervisor and supervisee in the case of investigations (e.g. disciplinary or complaints investigation) and to ensure that records are not altered in any way.

**N.B**. Where supervision notes refer to other staff/services, staff
should treat this as confidential in relation to the requirements of the
Data Protection Act 1998. Where possible the use of initials will help
to safeguard this information. Supervision files and records are the
property of WF and when employees leave; their Supervision Records
should be passed to their line manager. The file will be kept for at
least ten years. The supervisor will need to take appraisal records into
account.
