title: Parent and Child Placements
---


Children who have been in care are almost two and a half times more
likely to become teenage parents. Research suggests that almost half of
young women leaving care become parents within two years and research
studies have consistently shown that young women in and leaving the care
system are disproportionately more likely than their peers to become
pregnant or to already be parents. Whatever their reasons for becoming
parents the reality for the majority of young parents is that they live
at or below the poverty line.

Developing services which assist care experienced young people to make
informed choices about parenting is an essential part of the Wholistic
Fostering's Policy and Procedures. It is essential that services are in
place that can meet the practical and emotional needs of these young
parents while continuing to empower them to access opportunities for
education and any specific support they may need until they establish
themselves more independently.

Wholistic Fostering therefore identify the need to recruit and prepare
foster carers to undertake this work with this vulnerable group. Clear
policies and guidance to both carers and young people is required and
there are specific factors that need to be considered as part of their
placement strategy. During the placement preparation planning stage
Wholistic Fostering will work with the placing authority in undertaking
a risk assessment when the parent is over 21 years of age. (Appendix 1
-- Adult Risk Assessment). The purpose of this is to identify risk and
put in place protective factors so that the placement has the best
opportunity to be a success. Immediately:

      * Support and guidance in preparing for parenthood at a time when many are still developing their own maturity. 
      * Dealing with the changing relationship with their partner or having to accept that they will be coping alone. 
      * Dealing with family conflict; intergenerational conflicts that are heightened by pregnancy and may lead to initial rejection by their own parent(s). 
      * Unresolved feelings around past abuse and childhood trauma. 

Longer term:

      * Coping with the daily demands of caring for a baby or toddler. 
      * Managing on welfare benefits/limited finances. 
      * Difficulties in accessing educational and employment opportunities. 
      * Lack   of         adequate         moving-on       options             with      limited or         no        support (accommodation). 
      * Fear of failing and being subjected to scrutiny so that their child is in danger of coming into public care. 

## Why foster care?

The children of parents with a care history are sixty six times more
likely to be taken into care themselves" (Shadow Minister for Children
and Families - February 2006)

Foster care has an important role to play as a service for pregnant
young people or young parents. Foster care provides a family environment
of support and nurture for the young parent and their child. It can make
the difference between a young person being able to develop the skills,
knowledge and confidence to successfully parent their own child, or
being unable to assume parental responsibilities and their child also
entering the care system.

## The Foster Carer

It is good practice for the foster carer to meet and introduce herself,
and outline her family circumstances to the parent before a placement
commences. Ideally if a placement has been able to be identified at an
early stage and the parent is accepting of the care plan a visit for the
parent to the carers should be organised prior to placement. It is
important that the parent has by then already had the opportunity to
read the information booklet on Parent and Baby Placements

The foster carer will need to work alongside the parent and the child's
social worker and be involved with all relevant professionals from the
outset, and be invited to any of the Child Protection Conferences. The
foster carer will also need to be aware of the Care Plan and be told of
the other assessments which are being sought, and any prospective court
dates.

It is essential that all relevant background information relating to the
placement is provided prior to any Parent and Baby placement being made.
WF will provide the original duty referral which incorporates the risk
assessment. It our expectation that the social worker for the child
shares Background Information and provide other pertinent background
information such as the most recent case conference minutes which would
give an overview of the parent's previous parenting history and their
family network. The foster carer needs to be aware of the impact of any
past parenting experiences, and its likely impact on a parent's current
parenting capacity. All foster carers are required to have a safe
storage place in their homes for confidential documents.

The foster carer will be expected to offer guidance and assistance to
the parent in managing the care tasks for the baby. This may include
direct instruction, responding to questions, or offering practical
support such as accompanying the parent to parent/baby groups, health
visiting clinic, shopping etc. This could include appropriate modelling
of behaviour and demonstrating of techniques.

The foster carer will be expected to have knowledge of attachment issues
and how to promote attachment between the parent and child placed. The
primary attachment the baby needs to make is with his/her parent.

Some parents in parent and child placements are teenagers and the carer
will need to have some knowledge and understanding of working with
teenagers. In addition, for some placements there needs to be an
understanding of how drug and or alcohol misuse will impact on a
parent's ability to parent.

The foster carer will need to have a good knowledge of child
development. The foster carer can access additional advice from their
supervising social worker.

The foster carer will need to be familiar with recent guidance relating
to the care of babies covering areas such as weaning, changes in bottle
feeding; and the more recent research about cot deaths, which stresses
the need to avoid any bed co-sharing at night.

For the first 2 weeks of a placement it is usual practice for the carer
to provide a very high level of supervision. This will usually mean the
parent remaining with the carer apart from when the parent attends a pre
arranged professional meeting. The detail of such an agreement needs to
be clear from the outset of the placement.

The foster carer will be expected to keep a daily record, noting
observations of the parent's ability to respond to their baby's needs
including capacity to meet their physical and emotional needs,manage the
routine and the practical tasks of washing, shopping, budgeting etc.

Such observations will need to be passed on to the parent on a daily
basis so that a parent is kept up to date with their progress and the
plan for the work with the parent adjusted accordingly and kept under
review. It is also important that the parent is aware of the assessment
and advice of the carer and able to respond to any changes that are
needed as well as be informed of the progress that is being made.

The daily recording will focus on a parent's basic physical care of the
baby, and the quality of the parent/child interaction i.e. has the
parent 'emotionally connected' to the child. Equally important though to
record is the parent's ability to respond to the advice and support the
carer is offering. A parents' ability to budget, the maintenance of
their bedroom and their physical presentation and actual amount of 'time
out' of the placement are also important areas to record.

The foster parent will need be open and honest about accurately
commenting and recording a parent's strengths and difficulties. Such
observations need to be constructive with the foster carer looking for
any changes and areas of a parent's improvements, as well as any
problems and areas for additional support in their parenting. The foster
carer will need to stand back and be objective. The foster carer must
observe and advise the parent in a non-blaming manner. It is important
the carer is not collusive.

Recording will be on a daily basis with a monthly summary that provides
an overview. All such recording needs to be forwarded to the supervising
social worker who will then distribute them to the child's social worker
and other agreed parties. It is particularly beneficial for parent and
child foster carers to possess appropriate I.T. skills, so that
recordings can be completed in a accurate and readable format and then
forwarded by email to the supervising social worker.

The foster carer needs to at all times prioritise and promote the
welfare of the child, over and above the welfare of the adult parent in
placement. The carer will need to identify and intervene if a baby/child
is felt to be at risk, where a child remaining in a parent's care would
be detrimental to its welfare. Any such intervention would need to be
immediately passed on to the child's social worker, and the supervising
social worker.

Parent and child placements have a clear child protection remit, and
thus the carer will also be expected to challenge a parent in specific
circumstances if there are specific safeguarding concerns. The nature of
such circumstances should have been outlined in the initial Set up
Meeting.

Foster carers need to provide 24 hour support when required, and
transport parent and baby when appropriate and as agreed. A foster carer
will offer to baby-sit for one night a week, with an agreed amount of
notice if that is agreed as part of the placement plan and will also
babysit when a parent has to attend professional appointments.

The foster carer will provide a fully furnished, reasonably sized
bedroom complete with bed and cot linen, and ensure the parent has use
of a sitting room with home entertainment (this may be the family
communal living room) The foster carer will make available and provide
full use of baby/child toys and equipment for inside/outside home.

Once a placement is made, the foster carer and the supervising Social
worker will complete and provide a specific Safe Caring Family Policy in
relation to the individual parent and child placement, which will take
into account all the members of its family.

Such a plan will also outline the household's rules. There need to be
clear consideration of the role of any birth children to prevent any
collusion or unhelpful alliances.

It is important that specific matching process and document is completed
(the positives and any issues of concern that need to be focused on
within the placement). If a parent and child have been placed alongside
another foster child, then social worker for the other child in
placement needs to have been fully consulted about the match.

The foster carer will periodically check on the care and safety of the
child in placement, and therefore must have access to the child at all
times whilst it is in the home environment. This may need to be
highlighted at the initial Set Up meeting, where there may need to be a
discussion about amount of unsupervised time in the day a parent is
allowed to have in their bedroom with their baby.

The carer should on a regular weekly basis also check on the parent's
bedroom as part of the assessment of the parent's ability to provide a
suitable environment for the child. The carers' supervising social
worker and the child's social worker likewise need to ensure such
regular room checks are made and recorded for evidential purposes.

The foster carer will always seek medical advice/treatment for any
accident or injury a baby/child has sustained. Any accident or injury
should be fully recorded. A report to the child's social worker and her
supervising social worker must then be made as soon as possible.

The foster carer will respect and give recognition to the importance of
a parent and child's ethnic origin, cultural background, religion,
language, gender, sexuality and disability. These issues will need to be
considered as part of the initial set up meeting and additional support
and advice will be provided to the carer if that is required.

It is our expectation that the foster carer will attend pre-placement
meetings, reviews, core group meetings and any other planning meetings
as required. There is an expectation the foster will also be invited to
the Child Protection conference, as this would ensure that the carer is
aware of the role of all the other professionals working with the birth
parent.

A foster carer needs to identify someone in their network, who is CRB
checked, who could step in to provide additional support or cover for
the carer should the need arise.

The need for a separate respite Parent and Baby placement, should the
carer\[s\] have a pre-arranged holiday, must be discussed at the Set Up
meeting, so that all parties are aware there may be a brief break in the
continuity of the placement. No other respite provision would normally
be provided, unless there were exceptional circumstances.

Financial arrangements and expectations need to be discussed and agreed
at the set up meeting and kept under review as required.

The foster carer must from the start of the placement use a 'memory box'
for any child placed. The foster carer must record for example all
significant milestones and ensure at least weekly photographs are taken.
This should be discussed with the parent in placement and arrangements
made for copies of all the information and photos to be kept for the
parent.

Our Foster carers that have been approved for parent and child
placements have demonstrated their ability to provide the following.

      * Can provide individual care – not all young people want to be placed with others. 
      * They have the scope for matching to meet the cultural, religious, racial, ethnic and linguistic needs of the young person. 
      * They can work with young fathers, making them welcome as part of the “family” whether joining in at mealtimes, caring for the baby or babysitting. Boundaries may be needed but these can be set to meet individual circumstances. 
      * Good communication skills with teenagers. 
      * The ability to prepare care leavers for adult life.   Experience of handling difficult behaviour. 
      * Experience of working with a young person’s own family. 
      * An understanding of working in partnership with a range of other professionals (legal, social work, medical). 
      * Advocacy skills – either on behalf of young parent or their child. To enable and encourage the young parent to effectively put forward their views and wishes or to access other professional advocacy services. 
      * Ability to make daily and weekly recordings which forms part of the assessment process (see Appendix 2) 

## Specialist foster care placements

Some of our carers approved for mother and child placements have
demonstrated skills whereby they are competent enough to undertake
assessments and transfer their findings into a report.

### The Parent

The Parent will be expected to care for their baby/child at all times
unless there has been a specific agreement for the carer to take over
aspects of the baby's care for a specific limited period of time.

The Parent will be expected to manage the day/bedtime routine, which
needs to fit in with the foster carers' household. When a parent is
settling their baby into its bedtime routine, it is their responsibility
to check on the child throughout the evening until they retire to bed.
If it is felt that a baby monitor should for various reasons be
initially used, this may need to be discussed and agreed at the Set Up
Meeting.

The Parent will be expected to shop, budget, and cook for themselves and
baby/child and attend to all the requisite washing and ironing. The
Parent will keep his/her room tidy, and leave the communal
kitchen/bathroom in a tidy/clean condition after use.

Personal clothing and belongings must be kept in the parent's own room,
as the foster carer cannot be responsible for property or articles that
are lost or damaged in placement.

The Parent will contribute to the wellbeing of everyone in the foster
carer's home and in public by demonstrating
non-aggressive/non-threatening behaviours.

As part of the assessment process, the foster carer may make occasional
room checks to ensure the safety of parent and child, and therefore all
bedroom doors must be kept unlocked. Issues of privacy will be
acknowledged and discussed at the set up meeting.

The parent will be provided with the daily record sheets prepared by the
foster carer. The parent will be asked to include their own comments to
the recording sheets and sign the records. If there are any differences
of opinion these should be discussed ideally initially with the carer,
or with the social worker for the child, and these differences be
recorded.

The parent will be informed about the detail of the safe caring
agreement which will have been completed by the social worker for the
foster carer and the foster carer.

Parents will be informed that smoking is not permitted any where inside
the foster carer's home, but may be allowed in their garden if the
parent needs to smoke. This should be discussed at the set up meeting.
No alcohol is to be consumed or kept by the parent in the carer's home.

Parents will be informed that no involvement with any illegal substances
is permitted in the foster carer's home. However, it is recognised some
parents may be supported in a parent and child placement when a parent
is part of a substance misuse treatment programme. Specific arrangements
for the storing of medication for example prescribed methadone has to be
discussed at the set up meeting. The carer in turn will need to ensure
that the medication is used on the basis it is prescribed.

The Parent needs to inform the foster carer and child's social worker of
any appointments or assessment etc and check if childcare cover is
approved.

Parent's mobile phone usage needs to be compatible with living in a
family home. Any issues relating to the use of mobile phones will need
to be discussed at set up meeting.

A Parent's circumstances/history is strictly confidential to the named
foster carers and not their families/friends. Parents can feel reassured
that no discussions will take place about their circumstances between a
carer and their family members or friends.

### The Supervising Social Worker

The Supervising Social Worker needs to ensure full parental and child
information is passed on by child's social worker to the foster carer
prior to the placement commencing. Such paper work would include any
recent CP conference minutes and the Background Information report.

A fostering duty social worker needs to ensure that the duty referral
has been shared with the Parent and child carer.

The Supervising Social Worker needs to attend any Set Up meeting prior
to a placement or immediately following placement, and ensure there is a
full discussion about the expectations of the placement and the
envisaged time scales. In particular this meeting needs to examine and
clarify any concerns of a child protection nature which have been
raised, looking at how such risks could be managed by the carer in
placement.

The Supervising Social Worker at the placement meeting needs to ensure
all parties are aware of any training commitments the carer may have.

The Supervising Social Worker will be responsible for drawing up an
initial Safe Caring policy which covers all family members and their
roles. If there is another foster child in placement any specific issues
that would have been highlighted within the matching process needs to be
detailed

The Supervising Social Worker will visit weekly for the first four weeks
of the placement and then at least two weekly for the next four weeks.
At the end of this period four weekly visits will be undertaken to
provide supervision and support as well as weekly phone contacts. The
Supervising Social Worker will also need to undertake unannounced
visits.

The Supervising Social Worker should arrange to read and discuss with
the carer their recorded observations and provide additional advice as
required.

The supervising social worker will check with foster carers that they
have researched/accessed groups or courses available (if appropriate)
for the parent and baby in the local area.

The supervising social worker is responsible for monitoring, supporting
and supervising all aspects of the management of the placement.

### The Child's Social Worker

The social worker needs to ensure that the parent has a CRB if the
Parent is over 18 if there is another Looked After child in placement.

The Child's social worker needs to ensure the foster carer has all the
relevant information/paperwork at the outset of the placement. This will
include any recent Child Protection minutes, and the Background
Information record. The fostering team will be forwarding the carer the
duty referral.

It is important that all potential placements and referring field social
workers have a copy of our Parent and Baby information red booklet,
which are stored in each area office. The parent may need help in
understanding not only the purpose of the parenting assessment, but also
what such an assessment will entail.

The child's social worker will need to discuss the financial aspects of
the placement and ensure if appropriate the parent is making/can make a
single claim for Income Support prior to be placed.

The Child's social workers should inform benefit agencies (child
benefit, housing benefit) of the parent's situation.

WF expects the Child's social worker to visit during the first week of
placement and thereafter maintain a high level of visiting to ensure the
placement remains focused and that there is no delay in resolving the
permanence plans for the baby. There should be very regular liaison with
the supervising social worker.

It is absolutely essential to ensure that plans are put in place to
ensure the parent(s) will have suitable accommodation to move on to. The
Child's social worker needs to be proactive in resolving any
accommodation issues for the parent. Plans for rehabilitation for the
child with their parent in the community should not be held up due to
accommodation difficulties.

The child's social worker needs to be aware that once the placement is
made, the foster carer and her supervising Social worker will complete
and provide a specific Safe Caring plan, which will take into account
all the members of its family. Such a policy will also outline the
household's rules.

The Child's social worker should undertake room checks as required.

Should a dispute arise within the placement, joint visits should
initially be undertaken by supervising social worker and the child's
social worker The child's social worker may then arrange a meeting to
include the parent, supervising social worker, carer and the Manager if
the dispute has not been resolved.

Should the placement meeting agreement be breached, it is the Child's
Social worker's responsibility to organise a professionals' meeting to
discuss what this may mean in relation to the court proceedings.

The Child's social worker will also need to organise a later Placement
Rehabilitation meeting to discuss and plan for a parent and child's
rehabilitation in to the community. Such a meeting will need to focus on
the detail of the support that will be needed for this move to occur.

## The contract

We will work with the placing authority and the parent and child to
agree a written contract setting out the boundaries and expectations of
the placement so that everyone involved is clear about their role and
responsibilities.

Written agreements should cover factors such as:

      * Role and responsibilities of the foster carer. 
      * Role and responsibilities of the young parent(s). 
      * Role and responsibilities of the young parent’s social worker.
      * Role and responsibilities of the health visitor. 
      * Role and responsibilities of the supervising social worker. 
      * Role and responsibilities of the personal adviser/leaving care worker. 
      * Babysitting arrangements. 
      * Day care arrangements - to facilitate young parent attending work or education. 
      * Family contact. 
      * Any specific arrangements in relation to contact with the baby’s absent parent 
      * Financial arrangements. 
      * Equipment arrangements.
      * Review date. 

## Support

In policies, guidance and individual placement agreements it is
essential that carers are informed of the support available e.g. respite
care arrangements, out-of-hours services, and groups for foster carers
and young parents

## Training

General and specific training is provided to our foster carers on an
ongoing basis with emphasis on child development, assessment, recording,
child protection and advocacy. This training may take the form of one to
one or in a group setting. We also have a Fostering Support Worker who
has the skill, knowledge and training to provide practical assistance as
well as more general support to parent and child placements.
