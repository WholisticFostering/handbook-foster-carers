title: 🔔 Whistleblowing Policy
---


Wholistic Fostering is committed to the highest standards of openness,
integrity, and accountability. We want everyone --- foster carers,
staff, and young people --- to feel safe in raising concerns when
something doesn\'t seem right.

This policy provides a safe, confidential way to report serious concerns
without fear of victimisation.

## 🧭 What Is Whistleblowing?

Whistleblowing is the act of reporting serious concerns that are in the
public interest. It may include concerns about:

-   🧑‍⚖️ Unlawful conduct or criminal behaviour
-   ❌ Miscarriages of justice
-   🧯 Health and safety risks
-   🌍 Environmental harm
-   💰 Fraud or misuse of funds
-   🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Abuse of children, staff or carers
-   📉 Professional misconduct or unethical behaviour
-   🔒 Serious breaches of Wholistic\'s policies

> This is separate from complaints or grievances which relate to
> personal dissatisfaction or disagreement. Those should be raised under
> our [📝 Complaints Procedure](/policies/complaints).

## 🛡️ Protection for Whistleblowers

Anyone raising a concern in good faith will be protected. Wholistic does
not tolerate victimisation or retaliation. Reports can be made
anonymously, though named concerns are usually easier to follow up.

We encourage:

-   Staff and carers to raise concerns directly or with a colleague
-   Children to talk to a trusted adult or advocate

All concerns are handled with **confidentiality** and taken seriously.

## 📣 How to Raise a Concern

You can raise a concern:

-   Verbally or in writing
-   With or without your name
-   On your own or jointly with others

To help us act, please include:

-   What happened and when
-   Why you\'re concerned
-   What you've witnessed or experienced directly
-   Any documents or evidence (if available)

## 🔍 What Happens Next?

Within **10 working days**, you will receive:

-   Acknowledgement of your concern
-   Confirmation of any support available

Concerns may be:

-   Investigated internally by directors or managers

Some concerns can be resolved informally. Others may require a formal
investigation. We will keep you informed as far as possible.

## 👥 Support During the Process

You may bring a **trade union rep**, friend, or colleague to any
meeting. Legal support may be offered if you\'re asked to give evidence.

We aim to keep stress to a minimum and will offer reassurance throughout
the process.

## 📢 Taking It Further

If you\'re unhappy with the outcome or feel your concern hasn't been
handled properly, you may contact:

-   📞 The Fostering Network
-   🛡️ The Regulatory Authority (Ofsted)
-   🚓 The Police

We ask you to avoid disclosing confidential information when raising
your concern outside of the agency.

## 👶 Child Protection Concerns

Any concern involving the safety or welfare of a child must be treated
as a **safeguarding matter** and reported immediately in line with our
[🛡️ Child Protection Policy](/policies/child-protection).

If you believe a child protection issue has not been addressed properly,
you can:

-   Contact a **senior manager**
-   Report it to the **Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO)**
-   Notify **Ofsted**

We are a child-centred agency --- safeguarding always comes first.
