## 1. Introduction

Children who are in your care should be treated as part of the family
and you will be expected to transport them in the same way that you
would your own children.

A first aid kit and fire extinguisher must always be carried in the
vehicle.

Where outdoor activities are planned, first aid kits should be carried.

## 2. Seat Belts/Restraints/Car Seats

## 

## 

The term \'Child Restraint\' means \'Booster Seat\', \'Child Seat\',
Baby Seat\' and \'Booster Cushion\'.

All vehicle occupants must wear suitable seat belts or restraints at all
times when in vehicles.

Use the child seat for every journey, no matter how short. Make sure the
seat's harness (if it has one) is correctly adjusted so it is quite
tight, so that only one or two fingers can fit between the child's chest
and the harness. The harness buckle should not rest over the child's
tummy.

Only EU-approved baby seats, child car seats or booster cushions can be
used in the UK. These have a label showing a capital 'E' in a circle.

You can use your child's car seat in the front seat of a vehicle, if it
fits. This includes 2-seater cars or convertibles with the top down.

You must deactivate any frontal airbags before fitting a rear-facing
baby seat.

## 3. The Vehicle

The vehicle should be roadworthy with an up to date MOT and insurance
cover which includes fostered children. Your car documents will be
checked by the supervising social worker as part of the Health and
Safety check.

## 4. Managing Children in the Vehicle

It is a good idea to take toys, DVD's and books to occupy small children
on long journeys.

If the vehicle has to be stopped at the side of the road or on the hard
shoulder of a motorway, the hazard warning lights should be put on, all
occupants should get out of the vehicle and stand well away from the
road, and the emergency services must be called.

Male foster carer's should avoid travelling alone with a foster child.
If this cannot be avoided, the child should travel in the back of the
car. If there are two carers with a child, it will be safer for the
child to be in the front of the car rather than in the back seat with
one adult.

## 5. Mobility Allowance

You may be able to claim mobility allowance for Disabled Children,
(Under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, a child is disabled, and
will therefore be included in the definition of a Child in Need , if
s/he is blind, deaf or dumb or suffers from a mental disorder of any
kind or is substantially and permanently handicapped by illness, injury
or congenital deformity) speak to the child's social worker about this.
