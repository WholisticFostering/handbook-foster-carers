title: Management Absence Policy
---


Effective Date: September 2019

Purpose:

To ensure the continuous and effective operation of Wholistic Fostering
in the event of an absence of the Registered Manager, Patricia
Nettleford.

Scope:

This policy applies to all members of the Wholistic Fostering management
team, including the Agency Decision Maker (ADM), Responsible Individual
(RI), and panel members, as well as foster carers associated with the
agency.

Policy Statement:

In the event that the Registered Manager, Patricia Nettleford, is
unexpectedly unavailable:

Operational Management: Michael Dennis, the Responsible Individual, will
assume the operational management responsibilities of the agency.

Social Work Responsibilities: The Agency Decision Maker (ADM), who is a
qualified social worker and familiar with the agency\'s operations, will
take over the social work responsibilities on an interim basis.

Duration of Absence:

For absences anticipated to be less than 7 days, the above temporary
delegation of responsibilities will suffice. If the absence is expected
to exceed 7 days, Wholistic Fostering will initiate the process of
appointing an interim or permanent Registered Manager. This decision
will be made in consultation with the existing management team and in
accordance with regulatory requirements. Communication: All relevant
parties, including staff, foster carers, and external stakeholders, will
be promptly informed of these temporary changes in management
responsibilities.

Continuity of Care: During this period, the utmost care will be taken to
ensure that the quality of service and care provided to the children and
foster carers is maintained without disruption.

Review and Monitoring: This policy will be reviewed annually or in
response to changes in regulatory requirements or organizational
structure.
