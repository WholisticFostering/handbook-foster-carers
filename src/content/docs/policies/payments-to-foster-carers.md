## Foster Parents Allowance and Payments

Payment to foster parents for all placements are at the base rate of
£340 (2016) per child per week ( the following link is to the national
minimum allowance guideline table.
<https://www.gov.uk/foster-carers/help-with-the-cost-of-fostering> ) and
are expected to cover the following:

      * The Foster Parents allowance.
      * Respite.
      * General wear and tear caused by foster children within the home.
      * Pocket money.
      * General clothing.
      * Day care, when required
      * Birthdays and Christmas expenses.
      * Leisure and other ‘out of school’ activities.
      * Sports equipment.
      * Subscriptions to clubs (e.g. Scouts/Brownies)
      * School/college books and stationery.
      * Contributions to school funds.
      * Annual holiday and school trips.
      * Transport to and from local educational establishments.

All mileage within a 30 mile radius of foster parent's home to medical
appointments, contact arrangements, schooling, leisure, outing and
holiday activities, reviews meetings, court appearances, reasonable
escort duties, etc.

## Foster parents are not expected to cover:

      * Training
      * Therapeutic work or cost of work to cover special needs, obtain assessments etc.
      * Travel cost over 40 miles radius of the carer’s home will be reimbursed at .40 pence per mile

Foster Parents fees are reviewed annually each year.

NB- This is not an exhaustive list.

## Time of Payment

Currently, the fees we pay you as foster parents are from £306.00 per
child paid fortnightly. Payment is made by BACS. Yearly statements are
provided to all Foster Parents at the end of each finance year.

## Emergency Payment on Placement

An advance of up to £50 of the Foster Parent allowance can be paid prior
to placement.

If an emergency payment is made this should be record as it will be
deducted from the allowance when paid. The Supervising Social
Worker/Duty Worker should establish at the point of placement if an
urgent payment is required. If so this should be noted.

Urgent payments should only be requested in exceptional circumstances.
If you have any queries you can contact your supervising social worker.

## Complaints and Allegations

If a child is moved, or no placement made, due to an allegation,
complaint or concern having been raised, the Foster Parents allowances
will cease. ﻿ The decision to pay a fee during dispute will be made on a
case by case basis by the fostering Operational Manager in conjunction
with the Registered Manager.

Foster Parents will be informed of this authorisation by their
supervising social worker and/or Registered Manager at the earliest
opportunity; this will be followed up with written notification.

The payment of fees during investigation is a supportive measure to
ensure that the foster carer is not financially disadvantaged during
this period.

If a carer is suspended and children removed following an allegation the
fee and proportion of the allowance to cover continuing costs will be
paid for up to 4 weeks following the date of a strategy meeting
recommending investigation.

Whether or not payments continue beyond the 4 week point is
discretionary and will be decided on a case by case basis by the
Registered Manager who will consider any mitigating circumstances
leading to a delay in resolution which may be outside the carer's
control.

For more detail please view our Complaints policy here
<http://wiki.wholisticfostering.co.uk/doku.php/procedures:complaints>

## Equipment

﻿Wholistic Fostering acknowledge that a certain amount of equipment is
required in order for Foster Parents to undertake the fostering task. We
may be prepared to fund certain equipment, if the Foster Parent does not
already possess what is needed.

The decision to loan or purchase equipment will be made on a case by
case basis. The decision will be made by the Registered Managed.

## Replacement Cost

﻿If equipment needs to be replaced due to accidents or deliberate damage
by a foster child. The cost will be met by the Foster Parent as this has
been accounted for within the Foster Parents allowance.

## Respite

Please view the Respite Policy. [Backup carers and overnight
stays](/policies/core/back-up-carers-and-overnight-stays)

## Overpayment

﻿As Foster Parents are paid two weeks in arrears and two weeks in
advance; if a placement ends in an unplanned way overpayments are
sometimes made. Where an overpayment is made this will be deducted from
the next placement payment.

Where an overpayment is made in a planned ending of a placement it will
be deducted from the next placement payment.

If an overpayment is made, Foster Parents will be informed of this in
writing by Wholistic Fostering. If a foster Parent receives a payment
for a child, which they believe to be an overpayment, they should notify
their Supervising Social Worker. Your Supervising Social Workers will
discuss with HR the correct amount to be repaid and how it will be
recovered.

Foster Parents should send a cheque for the full amount to Wholistic
Fostering if the placement ended prior to Foster Parents receiving the
payment.

The remittance advice clearly states what the payment covers, e.g.
child's name(s) and placement dates.

It is an offence to spend money that you are not legally entitled to.

As Foster Parents you accept that you are 'self-employed'. As such, our
fee payments to you are not subject to tax or any other deductions by
Wholistic Fostering. The Inland Revenue has made specific provisions for
the taxation of self-employed Foster Parents and you are advised to
become conversant with these. It is your responsibility to make any
necessary declarations and arrangements in regard to tax and social
security payments.

## How fee\'s are calculated

We have calculated our fee\'s using a very straightforward formulae
which can be made available on request.

### Changes to the payments

Wholistic consults with foster carers in advance of any change to the
allowance and fee.

## Information on benefits

Foster Care Tax Relief allows foster carers to receive the first £10,000
in fees and also allowances up to £200 a week for a child under 11 years
and £250 a week for a child over 11. Carers may pay tax on anything
above this if they have already used their tax free allowance of
£10,000.

Carers who are tax payers should check with HM Revenue and Customs as
everyone's tax is different. Further advice on tax and benefits is also
available from the Fostering Network's Fosterline on 0800 040 7675.

The HMRC Website also has comprehensive guidance on all of these
matters:

<http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/foster-carers.htm>

Carers can claim income or housing benefits for themselves and their own
children and can choose either of the following options:

1\. Foster carers can be treated as self-employed and claim Working Tax
Credits - generally until the carer's youngest foster child reaches the
age of 18. Any income paid in respect of fostering (up to a maximum of
£10,000 per residence, plus £200 a week for each child under 11 and £250
a week for each child aged 11 or over) is disregarded for the purposes
of calculating entitlement to tax credits, and claimants need not fulfil
any work-related conditions.

2\. Foster carers may also choose to claim out-of-work benefits paid by
the Benefits agency. Again any income paid in respect of fostering is
disregarded. However, depending on their circumstances and the age of
the child they are caring for, a foster carer may be entitled to Income
Support, Employment and Support Allowance, or Jobseeker's Allowance --
each of which has different conditions attached to entitlement.

3\. Lone foster carers may claim Income Support however they are treated
differently to lone parents. While lone parents have been subject to
changes which require them to be available for work at a progressively
earlier time, lone foster carers, including those who are also lone
parents, remain entitled to Income Support until the foster child you
are caring for reaches 16.

Where foster carers are claiming benefits, they must declare any
retainer fees to the benefit agency if there is no child in placement.

There are new benefit proposals which may allow 8 weeks retainer fee to
be disregarded in future.

      * Children’s Tax Credit can only be claimed in respect of the foster carer’s own children.
      * Child Benefit cannot be received for any child for whom the foster carer is receiving a foster care allowance.
      * Disability Living Allowance can be claimed by the foster carer if they have a disability and for any disabled foster child whom they are looking after.
      * Incapacity Benefit can be claimed by foster carers, but the Department of Works and Pensions may regard fostering as an indication that the carer is able to work. Foster carers should seek advice regarding this, and consider appealing if it becomes a problem.
      * Working Tax Credit can be claimed by foster carers even if they are one of a couple or a single person with no children of their own as long as they are over 25 and work at least 30 hours a week. Fostering allowances are ignored as income.
      * Carers Allowance can be claimed by foster carers who are receiving at least the middle rate of the care component of Disability Living Allowance for a foster child. The carer will need to be regularly and substantially caring for the child (that is, caring for the child at least 35 hours per week); and must not be gainfully employed (that is, not having an income of more than £77 per week). Foster care allowances are ignored as income.
      * Pension Credit can be claimed under the same rules as Income Support. However between April 2010 and March 2020 the pension age of women will be increasing so foster carers need to check what qualifies as ‘pension age’ at time of claim.
      * Contribution based Job Seekers Allowance is not generally affected by fostering allowances. However, carers would need to be working less than 16 hours per week and, in addition to having a current Jobseeker’s Agreement; you would need to show that they are still available for and actively seeking full time work. The Department of Works and Pensions could find that fostering duties prevent carers from meeting the qualifying conditions leading to a loss of entitlement to JSA. Foster carers must notify the Department of Works and Pensions immediately after a child leaves placement if they are in receipt of JSA as the eligibility rules recently changed under this scheme.
      * Incomes based Job Seekers Allowance can be claimed by foster carers, but they would need to be available for work, capable of work and actively seeking work. Otherwise the rules are the same as for claiming Income Support. Foster carers must notify the Department of Works and Pensions immediately after a child leaves placement if they are in receipt of JSA as the eligibility rules recently changed under this scheme.

Foster carers are encouraged to keep up to date with any changes to
benefit entitlements and must seek direct advice from the Department of
Works and Pensions. The Wholistic Fostering Service is unable to provide
advice or guidance around benefits issues as these matters are
complicated and unique to each carers individual circumstances.

## Information on insurance

### Foster carer's insurance requirement

As a foster carer it is very important that your insurance policy covers
your foster children. When you become a foster carer with Wholistic you
must inform your Home and Motor insurance company that you foster. You
should also take the time to understand and be clear about how fostering
children will affect your existing policy or a new insurance policy that
you may apply for.

All children fostered by you must be included in your insurance policy.

Insurance companies will, for the purposes of the policy, include foster
children as members of your family. The Fostering Network recommends
that you ask your insurance company for written confirmation that they
have included your foster children on your policy and this view is
endorsed by Wholistic Fostering Service.

Wholistic Fostering service strongly recommends that Wholistic foster
carers have the following cover:

      - Household and contents insurance cover (Wholistic council tenants can buy this from Housing)
      - Buildings insurance for owner occupiers
      - Fully comprehensive motor vehicle insurance to keep within the law, including a valid licence and MOT
      - Holiday insurance for foster children’s holidays abroad

It is essential that you discuss with your insurance company what cover
your require and what will be suitable for you as a foster carer. It is
in your interest to make sure that you have the appropriate insurance
cover.

### Household, buildings and contents insurance cover

The key areas in relation to home insurance are accidental damage,
malicious damage and theft and physical attacks by a foster child.

The standard cover on most insurance policies does not cover you for
accidental damage within the home caused by a foster child or indeed
your own children. Your home insurance policy is likely to contain
restrictions relating to damage caused by children that you foster. It
is important that you inform the insurance company about any accidental
damage in order that they can record the information on their records.

Foster carers are advised to purchase cover for any of their own
children who are 18 and over and live at their home or they will not be
covered.

As foster carers there will be a number of professionals or indeed
families visiting your home. As a homeowner you could be liable for
damages caused to visitors to your home if you have failed to take
reasonable care to make sure that any visitor is safe. All policies,
which include contents insurance, should automatically provide cover for
any legal liabilities you have as the occupier of your home, for
yourself and any other member of your family living with you. Please
check with your insurers.

You can discuss with your insurance company how you can apply for
accidental damage cover.

Damage to your own property by malicious persons is normally covered by
a household insurance policy but most policies exclude deliberate damage
and theft caused by any member of your family or anyone permanently
residing with you which would include foster children. You must inform
Wholistic council of any deliberate damage or theft by foster children.
Foster carers should insure their buildings and contents for the full
replacement value including the value of the personal effects of any
foster child residing with them. Your policy needs to be sufficient to
meet the replacement costs in the event of any loss or damage.

### Motor vehicle insurance

Wholistic foster carers must comply with the law in relation to motor
insurance and inform their insurance company that they are fostering
children. The insurance company should be asked to provide you with
written confirmation that you have informed them that you are fostering.

The Transport Act and the Road Traffic Order 1995 state that seatbelts
must be fitted to all cars under a certain age in both the front and
back. It is the drivers' responsibility to ensure that any person
travelling in the car wears a seatbelt. Vehicles must also carry the
same number of passengers as it has seatbelts. If an accident occurs and
the vehicle contained more occupants than seatbelts then insurers may
not be in a position to help with a claim. Foster carers must also
ensure that cars are fitted with car seats appropriate to the age and
height of the child that they are transporting.

It is important that the motor insurance applied for matches the allowed
use of the vehicle. Any changes to the use of a vehicle may mean that
you are not covered for that change. Foster carers who escort other LAC
who are not placed with them will require business insurance and this
insurance can be provided by their insurance company for a small charge.

If you do not have a full licence or tax disc your insurance will be
treated as invalid and you would be breaking the law.

### Wholistic Fostering's insurance policy

Wholistic Fostering has a duty to provide you with information about its
insurance arrangements as they relate to fostering. This section will
provide you with general information regarding those arrangements in
relation to household insurance and motor vehicle insurance.

### Household buildings and contents cover

Where a foster carer is not covered by their insurance policy, because
damage by a foster child was caused deliberately, or where there is
excess payment on the policy, consideration will be given by the
department to meeting those costs. Foster carers must provide the
following information to the Fostering Service:

      * Written records of the incident, including time, date, details of loss/damage and any witnesses. Receipts should be attached if possible.
      * Copy of the insurance company’s response to the insurance claim.
      * Written estimate of the cost of the damage-or receipt if the damage has already been repaired.
      * The theft or loss should be reported to the police and you must keep a record of the police incident number.

The supervising social worker will discuss the claim with the foster
carer and then make a recommendation to the fostering team manager, the
Service Manager and the Wholistic Insurance Section.

### Motor Vehicle insurance cover

The council's insurance does not cover damage to foster carers own
vehicles. In the event of a claim causing the loss of a 'no claims
bonus' or increased annual premiums because of action directly
attributed to a foster child, the foster carer should provide full
details in writing to the supervising social worker who will discuss the
claim with the Fostering Manager. Financial assistance will only be
agreed in exceptional circumstances.

### Insurance through the Fostering Network

Wholistic Fostering Service pays for all its foster carers to be
individual members of the Fostering Network. This membership includes
insurance cover for foster carers in respect of legal advice and legal
expenses in certain circumstances. The Fostering Network insurance
policy covers:

      * Free legal advice in connection with possible legal action.
      * Legal expenses, in some circumstances, for the foster family for criminal prosecution brought against them for the mistreatment or abuse of the foster child placed with the family.
      * Access to a 24-hour legal advisory service for individuals or families.

The Fostering Network also has a legal expenses insurance scheme which
pays for the cost of any criminal prosecution brought against the
Fostering Network member or retired member and his or her parents,
husband, wife or partner and their children, all of whom are permanently
resident within Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or
the Isle of Man. The majority of civil claims are not covered by the
policy but the Fostering Network will refer the matter to the
underwriters upon request.

Legal expenses for criminal prosecution will only be paid on a 'not
guilty' plea and if the solicitor acting for you feels that you have a
good chance of success. In those situations claims would be paid even if
a finding of guilty were made.

For more information please contact the Fostering Network or look online
at www.fostering.net for their downloadable copy of the Legal Protection
Insurance User Guide.

### Public liability cover

Wholistic Council covers its carers in the case of public liability on
the basis of a legal obligation and only if your own insurance will not
cover you in the event of accidental injury or damage to property. This
is to a maximum of £50m for a single claim. Insurance checklist for
foster carers

      * It is essential as a foster carer to have adequate home insurance cover
      * Always inform your insurance company when you become a foster carer
      * Always ask your insurance company to confirm in writing that your insurance policy regards any children looked after as members of your family.
      * Always remind your insurance company when you renew your insurance policy that you foster.
      * Don’t forget if you change your insurance company you must inform the new company that you foster
      * Always tell your insurance company the maximum number of children you are likely to foster at one time and their ages
      * Always inform your insurance company if you consider there are any issues involving the foster child.
      * Please seek advice from a fostering manager regarding confidential information to be shared with insurance companies in respect of children looked after
