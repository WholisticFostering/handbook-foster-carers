title: 💷 Payments to Foster Carers
---


### Overview

We ensure that all foster carers receive regular and fair payments to
support the needs of the children in their care. Payments reflect the
level of responsibility and include allowances for everyday costs.

### 💸 What Payments Cover

Foster carer payments include an allowance intended to cover:

-   Food, clothing, and personal care for the child
-   Pocket money and day-to-day expenses
-   Birthdays, holidays, and festive occasions
-   School-related costs, extracurricular and leisure activities
-   Day care if needed
-   Local transport (e.g. school, appointments, contact)

### ❌ What Carers Are Not Expected to Fund

-   Foster carer training or professional development
-   Therapeutic or specialist services required by the child
-   Long-distance travel (with prior agreement)

### ⏰ Payment Process

Payments are made fortnightly by BACS. A year-end payment summary is
provided. Our rates are reviewed annually and carers are consulted
before any changes are made.

### 🚨 Emergency Payment on Placement

A small emergency advance can be made available at the point of
placement, if necessary. This will be recorded and deducted from the
following payment.

### 🛑 Payments During Complaints or Allegations

Where a placement ends due to an allegation or complaint:

-   Payments may be paused, depending on the circumstances
-   A decision to continue support during investigations will be made by
    the Registered Manager
-   A proportion of the allowance may be paid for a set period to
    support the carer

See: [Complaints & Representations](/policies/complaints)

### 🪑 Equipment

Wholistic may fund essential fostering equipment where needed. Costs for
damage caused by children (accidental or otherwise) are generally
considered covered within the carer's allowance.

### 💤 Respite & Retainers

For information on respite care or overnight stays with backup carers,
see: [Back-Up Carers & Overnight
Stays](policies/back-up-carers-and-overnight-stays)

### 💼 Overpayments

If an overpayment occurs, we will:

-   Inform carers in writing
-   Deduct the amount from future payments, or request a refund if no
    placement is active
-   Provide clear remittance details for all payments

### 🧾 Tax & Benefits

Foster carers are self-employed and may be eligible for tax relief.
Income from fostering may be disregarded for some benefit claims. We
advise all carers to seek independent advice or contact the Fostering
Network's Fosterline.
