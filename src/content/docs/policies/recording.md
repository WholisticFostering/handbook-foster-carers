## - Underpinning legislation and guidance

Employees, foster carers and children have the right to access their
personal records by putting their request in writing to the Quality
Assurance Lead at Wholistic.

The Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 require that a
fostering service maintains a range of specific records, the details of
which are outlined in regulations 22, 30 and 31 covering:

-   a register of children placed with foster carers
-   a register of approved foster carers
-   a record in respect of each person working for the fostering service
    provider, whether an employee of the fostering service provider, or
    employed by someone else
-   a record of accidents occurring to children while placed with foster
    parents
-   a case record for each approved foster carer
-   a record for each person who applies but who is not approved as a
    foster carer.

Regulation 32 covers retention and confidentiality of records and also
the duty to make records of formerly approved foster carers available to
another fostering service provider (see Policy on Maintaining, Storing
and Accessing Records).

These requirements are summarised in the Children Act 1989 Guidance and
Regulations.

Schedule 6 of the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011
specifies matters to be monitored by the registered person in a
fostering agency, including a number of records.

National Minimum Standard 26 requires that the fostering service has a
written policy concerning the information to be kept on files, that
staff, volunteers, panel members and fostering households understand the
nature of records, and that there is a system for monitoring the quality
and adequacy of record keeping and to take action when needed.

This policy outlines the purpose, format and contents of files, and
clarifies what information is to be kept on them. It also covers general
security issues and what to do in the event a case record or file goes
missing.

## - We keep the following records

-   Case records relating to foster parents and others
-   Register of foster parents

## - Confidentiality

Wholistic Fostering recognises that children are looked after for a
variety of sensitive reasons and they and their families have a right to
be treated with respect for their feelings and privacy. The general
principle is that you should not discuss the child's circumstances with
anybody who does not need to know. This includes your friends,
neighbours and members of your extended family. There will be other
people - for example, teachers and other professionals - who may need
limited information in order to help them provide the correct service,
but you, should consult the child's social worker any your supervising
social worker about what is appropriate.

It is sometimes easy to forget the need for confidentiality. For
example, you may be with a group of foster carers support or training
event and forget that other people may overhear your conversations. It
is therefore important to be conscious of the need for confidentiality
at all times.

Your friends and family will obviously know that you foster and they
will also play an important part in the child's life with you. They may
need some information to help them form a relationship with the child,
but you should think very carefully about what information is in the
best interests of the child and make a clear distinction between that
and everyday conversation. If you have any concerns please speak with
your supervising social worker.

The foster child may also need to talk about their situation and
attempting to place restrictions upon them would not be helpful. On many
occasions you can take your cue from the child if they are of sufficient
age and understanding, as they will be the best judge of what they feel
comfortable with other people knowing. On the other hand, you do have a
responsibility to protect the child from probing questions they do not
wish to answer and which will cause anxiety and embarrassment.

Your own children play an important part in your family's fostering and
should be given an understanding of the reasons behind any placement.
You should also ensure that your own children, if they are old enough,
also understand the principle of confidentiality. However, care should
be taken so that you do not inhibit the normal interaction that goes on
between children. Again please contact your supervising social worker if
you need guidance.

## - Day to day recording and carers' use of daily logs and diaries

It is vital that you keep a daily record of the events in the life of
the child and the rest of the household. This will help provide clear
information when you contribute to making plans about a child\'s future.
If kept properly, it might provide useful information for the child in
later life. It will help to protect children in your care, and safeguard
family members from false allegations. Records could be of use in a
Court hearing and may be requested by the Courts. If you have more than
one child placed, keep a separate record on each child.

Wholistic Fostering provides each foster carer with recording log for
each child that is placed with them, so a carer with a sibling group
which complete a separate log for each child that is placed. This is in
accordance with Data Protection and confidentiality guidelines. In some
circumstances these logs can be requested by the Court as evidence and
this why accurate recording must be maintained.

It is the expectation that you will complete a daily log for each child
or young person in your care. This information then helps the
supervising social worker complete a placement report that is forwarded
to the child's social worker each month and this in turn provides
ongoing an overview of how the placement is progressing.

Wholistic Fostering will also provide each carer with a diary in which
you can record appointments, meetings and contact arrangements.

All written placement information about a child must be returned to
Wholistic Fostering when the child leaves your home. You will be able to
access this information if the need arises in the future.

All information relating to a child that you store on a computer must be
deleted when the child leaves the placement.

Children, young people and their parents should be made aware that you
are making written records. This can be explained at the placement
agreement meeting.

Make sure that the child you are looking after knows that there are some
types of information you cannot keep confidential. The information you
record may be needed as part of an assessment or for court proceedings
or it may become part of a life storybook for the child.

It is good to share your recording with looked after children where age
appropriate

### - When to record

Records should ideally be made on a daily basis or as soon as possible
after the event or incident, whilst things are fresh in the mind. This
will help to ensure the accuracy of dates, time's conversations and
incidents. When giving evidence in Court it is particularly important
that any notes referred to were made as soon as possible after the
event.

### - How to record

      * keep the recording simple, clear and legible
      * notes do not have to be lengthy, just the main points
      * you should use language with which you are comfortable
      * do not worry about spelling or grammar
      * keep to factual information and do not be judgmental
      * accuracy is important when referring to specific incidents

### - Where to record

      * daily log 
      * and if asked a separate recording prior to attending a review or case conference
      * carers who have difficulty writing should discuss alternatives such as the use of a tape recorder

### - What to record

Remember to include positive as well as negative events. The following
list is not exhaustive but is meant to give some ideas about the sort of
information that you should record:

      * details of contact visits with child’s family, child’s reaction to contact (be factual and avoid opinion) and any observations about the quality of contact, such as interaction between the child and their parent – did they talk or play together? Also include anyone’s failure to visit and any reason given
      * details of any other form of contact – telephone calls, letters, birthday cards, etc
      * details of visits, meetings with social workers or other professionals and the child’s reaction if any
      * dates for reviews, case conferences, etc and decisions made
      * dates of medical or dental appointments and treatment given. Include dates of cancelled or rearranged appointments
      * dates and types of immunisation
      * date, type and length of any illnesses
      * details of any accidents or injuries, however slight. Describe what, when, where and how it occurred. Name any witnesses and action taken. Record the time, date and name of the social worker to whom the incident was reported, comments the child makes that give you cause for concern. Always record using the child’s own words
      * details of the child’s behaviour if it is causing concern. Note their actual behaviour, what happened before it started and how it was dealt with
      * any positive improvements, achievements and happy events for the child
      * dates when the child is away from the foster home – with family, friends, school trips, introductions to new carers or if they are missing
      * details of times when the child is with alternative care givers such as babysitters and who they were
      * any significant contact with the school or nursery such as comments about the child’s behaviour or parent’s evenings
      * any involvement with the police
      * details of any theft or damage caused by the child
      * details of any specific incidents, events or changes of circumstances of your household. Include any complaint disagreements with the child or their family
      * any significant milestones in the child’s development such as their first word or first steps. Some of these details may be recorded separately, for example on parent held medical records, school reports, assessment and action records or accident forms
      * any other significant event or information

### - General record keeping

The Fostering Services National Minimum Standards and the Fostering
Services Regulations 2002 place duties on us to maintain specific
information on carer's files and retain these for specified periods of
time.

The records kept by carers are important for a number of reasons:

      * they may be needed as evidence in Court proceedings
      * they may contribute to an assessment of the child and/or their parents
      * they are a valuable tool in monitoring a child’s progress
      * they can provide the child and future carers with an understanding of the child’s past and early life experiences
      * While each carer will have their own recording style, a number of key principles should apply:
      * Daily log books should be hand-written in black ink. The monthly summaries could be typed using a template which we will provide or handwritten in Black Ink
      * all factual information should be checked for accuracy such as spelling of names
      * records should be completed as soon after the event they refer to as possible
      * if different from the date of the incident, the date the record is made should be stated
      * records should be free from jargon and abbreviations
      * corrections made to records previously made should be dated and signed
      * records should distinguish between facts and the opinions of the carer

You are uniquely placed to make observations about the child's day to
day behaviour.

The amount of recording needed will vary from placement to placement. As
a minimum, you should maintain a daily log in which you not only record
appointments but also significant events or incidents for the child on
that day.

Some carers may use the daily log for more detailed observations on the
child while others will use it as an aide for their memory when
preparing reports for meetings such as statutory reviews.

In any fostering situation it will be useful to keep the following in
mind:

      * how well does the child form relationships with you, your family, their peer group and other adults?
      * do they find it easier to make relationships with children younger or older than them?
      * how do they react to attention or physical affection?
      * do they understand why they are being looked after?
      * can they talk easily about their past experiences?
      * how do they behave before and after seeing their family?
      * how do they respond to the rules of the house?
      * do they have any particular behaviour problems?
      * do they have any special needs that are not being met? (eg health needs or needs related to disability)
      * how do they feel about themselves?
      * what do they want in the future?
      * how are they getting on at school?

### - Health records

You should record details of:

      * any illnesses suffered by the child and how this was managed
      * any medical, dental or optical appointments or treatment in respect of the child should be noted on the daily log and also on the monthly summary
      * Any medication either prescribed or none prescribed that is given. This should be recorded on the [[http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp05-child-health-record-monitoring/|Child health monitoring form ]]that you have been given and sent into Wholistic Fostering at the end of each month along with your monthly summary
      * Any accidents that have taken place – an accident form should be completed in addition to entering this in your daily and monthly recordings

### - Contact

You should pay particular attention to ensuring that the outcome of
contact arrangements and their perceived impact on the child are
recorded.

While each child and each contact session may be different, you should
consider the following issues in every case:

      * the date and time of the contact
      * was this contact planned and agreed in advance?
      * the type of contact (eg face to face or telephone)
      * who was present at the contact?
      * did everyone who was due to turn up do so and were they on time?
      * was the contact supervised and if so by whom?
      * how long did contact last?
      * was this the scheduled length of time for this contact?
      * the child’s demeanour before, during and after the contact
      * was the child comfortable with those involved in the contact?
      * was the child anxious or reluctant to engage with anyone?
      * the demeanour of others present during contact
      * how did those attending contact respond to the child?
      * were agreed tasks for this contact completed?
      * how did the contact end?
      * was it clear to the child if and when they would have further contact?
      * was the child given anything during the contact such as presents or money?
      * did anyone put the child under undue pressure during the contact?

### - Control and sanctions

You must record all incidents involving physical restraint on the
[restraint
form](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp11-restraining-report/).
You will need to exercise your own judgment as to when other forms of
control and discipline warrant recording. An incident report should be
completed for anything other than a minor sanction. For example if a
child has had to be restrained in order to protect the child from self
harm or harm to others.This would be recorded on a restraint form and
the daily log. If a child becomes destructive towards personal or foster
Parents belongings, this should also be recorded in the daily log, and
additionally on an incident Form.

Some of the issues you need to take into account include:

      * did the child view the action taken as fair and appropriate?
      * was the action taken discussed with and/or witnessed by others?
      * was the action taken agreed by the child’s social worker and/or birth parents?
      * could any other party misconstrue the action taken or view it as inappropriate?

If you are in any doubt about whether any action taken should be
recorded or not, then this is probably an indication that it should. In
such circumstances you should record the incident and bring it to the
attention of the child's social worker and your supervising social
worker at the earliest possible opportunity.

### - Bullying

You should record on an incident report all suspected and actual
incidents of bullying against or by any child in your care. These should
be reported to the agency and the child's social worker as soon as
possible. You have been given an incident sheet to record any specific
incidents of bullying that you have observed or been involved in. This
should be completed in addition to the recording you have made within
your daily log and monthly log

You should also ensure that your supervising social worker is made aware
of the incident. We will keep a central record of all reported incidents
and the action taken to deal with them.

### - Accidents

All accidents experienced by foster children must be fully recorded as
soon after the accident as possible. And the agency should be informed
as soon as possible. We expect foster Parent(s) to keep a record of all
accidents in your daily log and in addition to this to complete the
[Accident/Illness
Form](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp08-accident-form/)
and forward this to Wholistic Fostering as soon as possible following
the accident. If you are concerned please discuss it with your
supervising social worker. The child's social worker must be informed of
the accident verbally as soon as possible following the accident

### - Incidents

Should a significant incident occur in or outside of the home this
should be recorded on a the [incident
form](http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/foster-parent-forms/wffp08-incident-form/),
in your daily log, and verbally reported the supervising social worker
as soon as possible following the incident. The incident record should
be forward to the agency no later than the following day. An example may
be an incident of bullying, physical aggression, destructive behaviour
or the need to restrain (also fill in a restraint form). To safeguard
yourself we advice that you complete the incident report whenever you
feel something has occurred that has concerned you, alternatively you
could call the agency if you are unsure.

### - Life story work

National Minimum Standards for the Fostering Standards of the 24.5, 24.6
and 24.7 sets out the requirements for carers and local authorities to
help children understand and reflect in their past. The Standards also
makes clear the necessity and requirements for local authorities to give
carers the relevant information about the child and to preserve
appropriate memorabilia and photograph albums

Life work is often a requirement from the Courts or Children's Guardians
and it is a vital piece of work, which is considered to be good
practice, and essential for all children, particularly those placed for
adoption or permanence. A child or young person may come to you from
home, another foster placement or residential unit. Whilst social
workers will always try to minimise the number of moves a child has
there may be situations where this is unavoidable. It is therefore very
important that a good record is kept of each move from the day of
placement until such time as a child leaves. The carer's diary will
record key events and issues for the child and this can be an invaluable
tool at a later stage for beginning life work. There should be a record
of all achievements, however small, and any developmental milestones.
Within our own families most children will have a number of anecdotal
memories that have been passed on over the years. These are just as
important for children who are looked after, that first step or tooth
falling out, the special toy or name the child had for someone are
memories others take for granted but to a child who has had a traumatic
and disrupted past they can help to create a history and through this an
identity

All looked after children (other than in emergency or short-term
placements) should have a life-story book. This normally takes the form
of a photograph album with contributions from the child, their family
and the foster carers. This is important for the child as it is vital
that they should have a sense of continuity and be able to remember and
talk about past experiences.

You will need to ensure that you have photographs of yourself and your
family available and that you can help the child write in their own
words why they are with you and what they would like planned for the
future. In some instances a child may come to you without such a book
and you will need to discuss this with the child's social worker and/or
your supervising social worker. In other instances, the gathering and
sharing of information with the child will be part of the task you and
the social worker need to share in order to help the child return home
or move to a permanent placement.

Some of the issues that arise from this work may be painful for both you
and the child. It is, however, very important that you are honest and
explain as much as you can according to the child's age and
understanding. If however it has been agreed at a professional level
that the

Child's needs therapeutic input in respect of addressing their Lifestory
then we advice our foster carers to maintain a low key approach and
report any adverse information or reaction to us. We will then raise
this with the child's social worker and agree a plan of action in
respect of what is expected of you. Foster carers are not therapists and
we do not expect our foster carers to act as such.

At other times your foster child will just want to talk with you about
things that have happened in the past, worries in the present or
anxieties over the future. Again, you must be honest. Evasions and
half-truths will lead to confusion and lack of trust. If you are in
doubt about what to say or do not know the answer, you should suggest
that the child either asks their social worker or parents or agree to do
so yourself.

Research tells us that most children who have begun the process of
coming to terms with their past settle and adjust more easily. The
life-story book can help this process. Remember that children will only
communicate deep feelings to people they trust. There must be a
trusting, consistent relationship with the child before life-story work
begins.

Collecting mementos and recording life events

Like life story work, collecting mementos can make an important
difference to a child's memories. This can be any item no matter how
trivial it seems to you, as it may be important and have meaning for the
child.

A child may bring mementos with them, or they may choose to bring
nothing, hoping to wipe out difficult memories. On the other hand they
may have nothing to bring. It is a good idea to keep a child's mementos
in a special place decided, and perhaps decorated, with the child. We
refer to these as memory boxes

Significant items and events such as a newborn baby's hospital identity
tag or a child's first steps should be kept and passed to the child or
their social worker at the end of the placement. You should consider the
use of video or photographic records for events such as birthdays or
holidays, but be sensitive to the wishes and feelings of the child and
their family. Care must be taken to ensure that no child is photographed
or recorded in the bath or a state of undress.

Copies of any video or photographic material should be made available to
the child and/or their parents when they leave a placement. Any
additional costs incurred can be re-claimed via your supervising social
worker.

### - Storage and retention of records

During the course of a placement, you should ensure that information is
kept secure and cannot be accessed by anyone else. Ideally this should
be in a lockable file or cabinet that is also fireproof and waterproof.

At the end of a placement, any reports or other records provided to you
or kept in respect of the child should be returned to the child's social
worker.

Other information, such as diaries, should be retained securely by you,
and then passed to Wholistic Fostering via either your supervising
social worker or the child's social worker to be included in the child's
file. If you cease to foster and wish to dispose of any retained
confidential information, you should first discuss this with your
supervising social worker.

Records about foster carers

We are required by law to keep records of all approved foster carers.

All files in respect of approved carers will contain as a minimum:

      * a record of the initial screening process
      * the carer’s application form
      * the original report on the assessment of the carer and any other reports submitted to the Fostering Panel
      * a record of the carer’s attendance and performance at a preparation group
      * the information obtained in relation to the assessment, approval, review or termination of approval of the carer
      * the notice of approval
      * the Foster Carer Agreement
      * annual reviews of approval
      * notices of the outcome of reviews of approval, including revised terms of approval or notices of termination of approval
      * any agreement entered into by the carer in respect of an emergency placement
      * a record of each placement made with the carer, including the name, age, ethnicity, religion and sex of each child placed, the dates on which each placement began and terminated and the circumstances of the termination
      * the carer’s safe caring guidelines (family Policy)
      * the carer’s training portfolio
      * the carer’s training profile in respect of Learning and Development
      * a record of any complaints or allegations made in respect of the carer, together with the details of any investigation, its outcome and any action taken
      * evidence of management oversight and audit

### - Carers contributing to records

We encourage all carers to contribute to their case records. There will
be a number of formal opportunities to do this, including:

      * feedback on placements
      * End of Placement reports
      * annual reviews
      * the creation and maintenance of your training profile
      * the creation of your individual safe caring guidelines

Where you identify a factual error in information held, this will be
corrected immediately.

Where you disagree with an opinion or judgment of your supervising
social worker or others and it is possible to reach agreement on
amendments to the record, these will be made. If it is not possible to
reach agreement, your views will be recorded alongside the social
worker's.

## - Register of foster carers

We are also required to maintain a register of approved foster carers,
which includes the following:

      * the name, address, date of birth, ethnic origin, religion and sex of each foster carer
      * the date of approval and each review of approval
      * the current terms of approval

### - Access to records

Every carer has an electronic record which stores all information kept
on you. This includes details of your original application, the Form F
written on you, subsequent annual reviews and regular recording of your
supervision meetings, any allegations or complaints, training and
development records, including your annual PDP (personal development
plan).

These will be retained for at least 10 years after the date that your
approval was terminated.

#### - Data Protection Act 1998

The right of access to information is now determined by the most recent
Data Protection Act 1998 (Data Protection Act) which came into force on
31st March 2000. It incorporates the Access to personal Files Act 1987
and Access to health Records Act 1990.

The Access to Personal Files Act 1987 encouraged a more open and sharing
way of working with service users.

All information whether on manual or computer records is subject to the
new Data Protection Act.

The Data Protection Act requires that personal data shall be:

      * Adequate, relevant and not excessive
      * Accurate and where necessary kept up to date
      * Not kept for longer than is necessary for its purpose

Service users have a right of access to the information held about them,
which includes:

      * Factual information
      * Expressions of opinion
      * The intentions of Wholistic Fostering in relation to their case

Where access is refused, service users may appeal to the courts or the
Data Protection Commissioner.

      * Restricted access

Information may still be restricted where:

      - Disclosure may interfere with the prevention or detection of crime.
      - Disclosure will prejudice social work or cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the service user.
      - Disclosure of physical or mental health information cannot be made without consulting an ‘appropriate health professional’.
      - Information is restricted by statue, e.g., adoption records, parental order records, section 30 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.

Under the Data Protection Act all information given to carers in line
with the placement and recording made by the carer about the child or
young person must be returned to Wholistic Fostering Services who will
arrange for them to be returned to the appropriate Department. Any
information held about children must not be shredded.

### - Confidentiality

Much of the information you give us, or which others give us on your
behalf, is personal. We Respect this, and we make sure it is kept
securely, remains private, and is not normally shown to anyone outside
of Wholistic Fostering (including other members of your family) without
your knowledge and consent.

On occasions, we may be asked to share information with other
professionals, for example, your family doctor. However, this
information would normally only be disclosed with your knowledge and
permission.

There are some occasions when we are legally required to disclose
information without your consent, for example:

      * To the Police or Court in serious legal or criminal matters.
      * To statutory bodies.
      * To avoid serious harm to yourself or other people.

If you have any doubts or questions then please raise them with either:

### - How do I ask to see the information held about me?

Your supervising social worker will of course be sharing information
with you on an on-going basis. However, if at any time you wish to make
a request to see your records, please contact the Fostering Manger who
will supply you with a form that should be completed before a copy of
your records can be accessed.

#### - How long will it take?

If you make a formal request to see your records, the process can take
up to 30 days from the date all relevant information has been received
from you.

#### - What if I think the information is wrong?

If you think any information held in your file is wrong (including any
computerised records), you should inform the Fostering Manager in
writing, giving specific details of the inaccuracy or information
omitted. If the query is straight forward, you will receive a reply as
soon as possible. If it is complicated or requires further investigation
then the reply will take up to 30 days.

If we agree that the information is wrong then we will correct it. If we
don\'t agree, we will make a note in your file that you disagree with
some of the information recorded.

### - Information on Children in Placement

If the placement is made in a planned way with introductions then you
may be given the Statutory placement paperwork prior to the child
arriving. Even if a child is placed in an emergency you must make sure
that you have been given sufficient information to help you keep the
child and you and your family safe. When a child leaves a foster
placement all of the paperwork relating to them must be given back to
his or her social worker, along with the life storybook and any other
mementos you may have collected. You must ensure that you pass on any
details about outstanding appointments too. After a child leaves you may
find further information relating to them and you must always send this
to the social worker's district office to be placed on the child's file.
This must include either the original or a photocopy of your diary
relating to the child's time with you.

## - Access to Files

Children and young people have a right to see their file and they can
make such a request at any time. They must be prepared for some delay,
as the social worker will need to go through the file to check there is
no information relating to other members of the family to which the
child should not have access or there are reports from other
professionals, which are deemed confidential. You will need to work
closely with the social worker before and after a child has access to
their file as it can, in some cases, be a very distressing event.
Children may have rewritten their history in a way that they can cope
with and a file can open up feelings that have been long buried. However
it is important that children and young people know why they are living
away from home, and often after the initial disruption children cope
better knowing all the facts.

## - Seeking records for Schedule 2 of Fostering Regs

1.  A record in the form of a register showing in respect of each child
    placed with foster parents is accessed via Charms
