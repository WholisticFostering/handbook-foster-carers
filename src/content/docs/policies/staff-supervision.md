At Wholistic Fostering, we believe that **effective supervision is key**
to maintaining high standards of care, supporting staff wellbeing, and
achieving the best outcomes for children, young people, and foster
carers.

This policy explains:

-   What supervision is

    people

Supervision is part of a wider performance and development framework. 👉

Policy](/policies/performance_and_development_policy)
