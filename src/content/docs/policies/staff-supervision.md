title: Staff Supervision
---


This policy sets out how employees can expect to be supervised and
provides managers with the key elements needed to carry out supervision
effectively.

Wholistic Fostering Services (WF) remains committed to the professional
development, personal development and the support of employees through
supervision as part of a wider performance management framework. (See
[Performance and Development
Policy](/policies/performance_and_development_policy)) This document
applies to all social workers and social work managers and to all
employees working directly with WF foster carers and the children and
young people they look after.

Professional supervision can make a major contribution to the way
organisations ensure the achievement of high quality provision and
consistent outcomes for people who use our services (children, young
people and foster carers). High quality supervision is also vital in the
support and motivation of workers undertaking demanding jobs and should
therefore be a key component of retention strategies .

Supervision is the process of reflecting on practice issues, planning
interventions, sharing information and decision making, developing
improved practice to support children, young people and foster carers,
implementing quality assurance and supporting continual professional
development.

Conducted in a supportive environment, supervision facilitates an open
and honest twoway communication, which facilitates mutual learning,
enhances accountability, and facilitates improved practice outcomes for
those within the service we provide.
