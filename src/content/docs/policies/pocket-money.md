title: Pocket Money Policy
---


Pocket Money and Savings are typically set at 10% of the carers
allowance.

For example, a 10% of a £200 pw allowance would make £20 pw available
pocket money and savings.

We make recommendations on a minimum amount for savings as detailed
below but the percentage split is usually the choice of the carer.

This gives carers flexibility to change the balance at their discretion
but also helps us ensure that pocket money is saved consistently.

-   At Age 0 - 4 years: Pocket Money up to 10% \| Remainder as Savings
-   At Age 5 - 10 years: Pocket Money up to 20% \| Remainder as Savings
-   At Age 11 - 15 years: Pocket Money up to 40% \| Remainder as Savings
-   At Age 16 - 18 years: Pocket Money up to 60% \| Remainder as Savings
-   At Age 18+ years: Pocket Money up to 80% \| Remainder as Savings

Our Policy is designed to encourage savings but also recognise that as
children become older they will need to spend more on there daily
requirements. It also leaves carer\'s some discretion in recognition of
all children being unique but sets aside a compulsory allocation for
both savings and pocket money for children and young people.

# Enabling a Lac to Override the percentage split

In the event of a child or young person insisting that they would
strongly prefer to receive a high amount of the allocation then the SSW
can enable this.

The maximium percentage amount to be given as pocket money is 75% under
18 and 95% over 18 because some money should always be saved to
encourage this practice.

When an SSW has agreed an increase from the standard amount a child
should be asked to sign a declaration that they understand the
implications of reducing their savings means that they may not be in as
strong a position when they leave and that saving is in their own
interests whereever possible.
