## Introduction

Use of the internet and social networking has become an essential part
of growing up in in the 21st century. There are many benefits to such
technology and it allows children from an early age to access education,
on-line activities and games, worldwide communication and information as
well as social networking. Social networking is a huge phenomenon
particularly for teenagers. The way that such media can be accessed has
also changed and it is no longer confined to a computer but children and
young people access sites via their phones, games machines and the
internet television.

For some young people the internet plays an important part in how they
keep in touch with their friends and family -- this may be particularly
important for children and young people who may have had multiple
placement moves or are moved to different areas as it may be their main
means of contact with those they have known in previous placements.

Unfortunately although there are many benefits of the use of the
internet and social media there are also challenges which cannot be
ignored. This is the same for all but those who are vulnerable are more
at risk of becoming victims. There are also additional issues for looked
after children that need to continually be considered, for example,
contact with people who may pose a risk to them, as well as their own
general safety.

Safeguarding children and young people in this 'virtual world' has
become a key part of protecting them and keeping them safe. It is
therefore crucial that foster carers have enough knowledge and
understanding to help protect the children and young people that they
look after while also encouraging the positive use of technology.

## Role of the Supervising Social Worker

1.  Assessing and supervising social workers should talk to foster
    carers about e-safety and how they will protect the children and
    young people in their household. This should be incorporated within
    their family safe care policy which should be updated with each new
    placement into the household.\
    \
    Foster Carers also need to know information about what digital
    devices the child and young person has access to and how much they
    use it. Ideally the situation regarding digital and internet safety
    should be discussed as part of the placement planning meeting which
    should include the child or young person (subject to age and
    understanding). Areas that should be discussed and clarified could
    include:\
    \* What role has digital and internet technology played in the child
    or young person's life?

\
\* What can the child or young person use it for? E.g. school work,
social networking, gaming etc.\
\* What equipment does the child or young person have where they will be
able to access the digital world?\
\* How might this be used to help children and young people stay in
touch with people they wish to be in touch with e.g. Skype, Facebook or
other social networking sites? Are there any restrictions regarding
contact?\
\
- Supervising social workers should continue to discuss areas of
e-safety as part of their supervision sessions making it relevant to
children and young people in placement.

## Training and Support for Foster Carers

All foster carers should be encouraged to have a basic understanding of
the internet and digital technology. It is so much part of society today
and it will be part of a foster carers role to help children and young
people to make use of the benefits of it and to stay safe. The training
programme for foster carers includes a module on Internet, Social Media
and Mobile Phones.

Fostering Network publish a book called "Fostering in a Digital World --
a common sense guide", by Maria Boffey. This is a very useful resource
for foster carers, giving explanations of what things are, as well as
handy tips to help carers work alongside children and young people and
teaching them to use the internet in a safe way. It covers topics such
as online grooming, sexting, cyber-bullying, parental controls, use of
facebook, twitter, skype, online gaming etc.

In addition to this, BAAF publish a book called "Foster Care and Social
Networking -- A guide for social workers and foster carers" by Eileen
Fursland. This is a helpful and practical book that carers and staff may
find useful.

Foster carers should be encouraged to ask for support if they need it
regarding the world of digital technology. Some will find it easier to
keep up to date than others and if foster carers are finding it
difficult they should talk to their supervising social worker, the child
or young person's social worker or talk to other foster carers.

## Foster Carers' Guidance for Managing Media and E-Safety Within the Household

Foster carers have an important role to play in helping and encouraging
young people to access the benefits of communication technology in the
safest way. Foster carers do not require extensive knowledge and
experience of communication technology to be able to help. Everyday
parenting skills like sharing an active interest, supervision and
developing the young person's ability to keep safe can be very useful.
However, there are basic computer awareness courses available for adults
and it may be useful for foster carers to access these to help build up
their own confidence with using the computer. Below is some guidance to
help foster carers and all those in their household to stay safe within
the world of media and technology:

1.  Foster Carers should actively use the internet with children and
    young people, encouraging an open dialogue and asking about what
    they are doing. This may well help with the carers understanding as
    well as give an opportunity for the carer to know the kind of things
    that the child or young person is doing.

\
- Talk to the child or young person about what they are doing when they
on the computer or using games machines etc.\
- It may be helpful to set up rules or a family agreement regarding
internet use and this may need to be for individual children depending
on their age and maturity. This may include amount of time spent on the
computer as well as safety online. (See Appendix 1 for a suggested
template which is associated with the Fostering in a Digital World book
and are available as templates which can be adapted via the website link
in the book).\
- Check out what the child or young person knows. It can be easy to
assume that all young people are experts in technology and know how to
protect themselves online. Children who may have missed schooling may
also have missed this teaching at school.\
- Limit the amount of time that can be spent on the internet -- it
should be an activity but not the sole activity available!\
- Use security software to try to reduce the risk of virus, adware etc.
Never share your passwords with the children and young people.\
- Install parental controls appropriate to the age of the child or young
person. This should be done on TV's and gaming machines as well as on
computers.\
- There are search engines which are set up for use by children e.g.
Yahoo! Kids and Ask Kids (aimed at children 6 -- 12 years). With older
children search providers and internet security software can be filtered
which should allow unsuitable material to be filtered out. Foster carers
should familiarise themselves with the filter option as a means of
monitoring material.\
- Foster carers should try to familiarise themselves with how social
networking works so that they can be aware of the risks. This includes
internet chat where children and young people can visit chat rooms
online, chat to others that they are playing an online game with or chat
individually with another person who is on line. Facebook is for those
who are over 13 years of age, however, if a false date of birth is put
in there are no checks so children under 13 may access it. If a foster
carer discovers that a child or young person has accessed social
networking sites inappropriately they should talk to the young person
and the social worker and supervising social worker.\
- Access websites which give guidance on safety on the internet etc (see
below). The good ones will keep up to date and give useful guidance
regarding current risks.\
- Foster Carers should check the history on computers. It will show
websites that have been visited.\
- MOST IMPORTANT -- foster carers should talk to children and young
people about the positive use of media and the internet and also the
risks involved. Teach them the SMART tips listed below.\
- Do not be afraid to ask the child or young person questions about what
they are doing. For example, how much personal information do you give
out on the internet? What do you enjoy about using facebook or other
social networking sites? Do you feel safe on the internet? What would
you do if you do not feel safe?\
- If a foster carer has any concerns regarding a young person accessing
inappropriate material, being bullied, bullying others, having contact
with people that they shouldn't or any other issue relating to their
access to the media, talk to the social worker and the supervising
social worker.\
- Care should be taken if use of the internet or digital technology is
going to be used as a sanction for poor behaviour. It would be
inappropriate for children and young people not to be able to use it to
access information that they need to research as part of their
education. It would also be important not to restrict contact
arrangements which may be agreed as part of the care plan and make use
of digital technology. However, foster carers may want to limit the use
of digital/internet technology. However, they need to bear in mind the
length of time that this is restricted for and to be realistic about
children and young people accessing what they wish to access via other
devices.

## Safer Caring for Foster Carers

If the right protection is not in place, the computer could potentially
be misused by someone in the foster carer's household. This could
include:

-   The computer becoming infected by a virus, destroying important
    personal documents.

\
\* A foster carer's own personal information could be accessed which
could potentially make them vulnerable to fraud e.g. access to bank
accounts or online accounts.\
\* Downloading of illegal or pornographic images.\
\* Accessing and digitally altering photographs.\
\* Using a fake identity on a social networking site.\
\
It is therefore important that foster carers apply appropriate caution,
are aware of who is using the computer and use password protection where
necessary. Children and young people may bring their own computer/games
console etc in to the foster home. If this occurs it is best to discuss
openly, ideally at the placement planning meeting, as to how this can be
used. Just because it is the child or young person's equipment does not
mean that the foster carer should not have rules around its use and how
to keep a child safe on it as a good parent would.

## Use of Facebook and Other Social Networking Sites

Foster carers should not make information publically available about the
fact they are a foster carer and should be careful not to post online
any information or photographs of children or young people that they
look after.

Foster carers should consider very carefully before agreeing to be a
"friend" to family members of the children or young people that they
look after. This could risk potential conflicts or repercussions at a
later date. Foster carers should also discuss the use of facebook or
other social networking sites with their own children so that they do
not compromise privacy and confidentiality by putting a comment or
photograph on the site about the looked after child or young person.
Consideration should also be given to whether it is appropriate for
foster carer's own children to "friend" another child in placement on
social networking sites and also whether a foster carer should become an
online "friend". Depending on privacy settings friends and sometimes
friends of friends can have access to private information that you would
prefer they didn't have access too.

## Keeping Up To Date -- Information for Children, Young People and All Adults Working With Them

The world of technology is changing fast and for the most up to date
information it is best to access reliable websites. However, there is
also a chapter in the Safer Caring book (published by Fostering Network)
which is all about 'mobiles, messaging and the internet'. A new updated
version of this book has been published and that includes a chapter
called "Safer Caring in a Digital World" which ideally carers should
read. These chapters include useful information as well as helpful tips
to manage some of the issues which could arise from the digital world.

Fostering Network also have an information sheet regarding Social
Networking and Facebook. Foster carers and social care staff can access
this from the member's areas of the Fostering Network Website
on[www.fostering.net](http://www.fostering.net/).

Also the "Fostering in a Digital World -- a common sense guide",
published by Fostering Network in 2013 is a good resource.

Children need to be taught from an early age how to use technology in a
safe way and it is important that foster carers talk to the children and
young people about staying safe and about the risks involved.

Foster carers should ensure that young people are aware of the SMART
tips see [www.kidsmart.org.uk](http://www.kidsmart.org.uk/):

-   **S**afe - Staying safe involves being careful and not giving out
    your name, address, mobile phone number, photograph, school name or
    password to people online.

\
\* **M**eeting - Some people you have contacted in cyberspace can be
dangerous. Only do so with your parent or carer's permission and when
they can be present.\
\* **A**ccepting - E-mails or opening files from people you don't really
know or trust could get you into trouble - they may contain viruses or
dangerous messages.\
\* **R**emember - Someone online may be lying and not who they say they
are. Stick to public areas in chat rooms and if you feel uncomfortable
simply get out.\
\* **T**ell - your parent or carer if someone or something makes you
feel uncomfortable or worried.\
\
Some very useful websites are:

[www.getsafeonline.org](http://www.getsafeonline.org/)

[www.thinkuknow.org](http://www.thinkuknow.org/)

[www.ceop.police.uk](http://www.ceop.police.uk/)

[www.childnet-int.org](http://www.childnet-int.org/)

[www.kidsmart.org.uk](http://www.kidsmart.org.uk/)

[www.chatdanger.com](http://www.chatdanger.com/)

These websites include information for children and young people of
different age groups as well as advice for parents and carers. On some
you can also ask them to send you up to date information so you can try
and stay ahead of the game! There is information on the websites
regarding use of the internet, chat rooms, mobile phones, gaming and the
television. They will give tips on staying safe and also provide advice
as to parental controls that you may be able to set up.
