title: Views of care provision
---


As part of the regulations we are required to regularly gain views on
the care provision from the child\'s family, social worker and IRO.

We have a schedule where surveys are sent out on a quarterly basis (1st
March, 1st June, 1st September and 1st December)

We have two separate surveys which are:

        - [[http://surveys.wholisticfostering.co.uk/index.php/658567?lang=en|Placement 3 month survey for professionals]]
        - [[http://surveys.wholisticfostering.co.uk/index.php/461585?lang=en|Placement 3 month survey for families]]
