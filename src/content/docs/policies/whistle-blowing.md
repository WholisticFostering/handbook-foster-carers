title: Whistle Blowing Policy
---


Wholistic is committed to the highest possible standards of
professionalism, service delivery, openness and accountability to its
employees, foster carers and children that they look after.

Wholistic wants to know about unacceptable behaviour, corruption, bad
practice or fraud and has introduced its whistle blowing policy to
encourage employees, foster carers and children in feeling confident
about raising concerns whilst being protected from possible reprisals or
victimisation if disclosures are made in good faith.

All information received through the whistle blowing policy is kept
confidential and that the person you talk to is independent, experienced
and has sufficient authority to ensure proper enquires are carried out.

Initially, employees, foster carers and children may wish to use
Wholistic\'s existing complaint or grievance procedures as set out in
the foster carer and supervising social worker portfolios. However,
Wholistic recognises that there are times when concerns are so serious
that the employee, foster carers and children may not feel confident
about using these methods but would be happy to raise them in a more
confidential way. The whistle blowing policy allows you to do this.

The whistle blowing policy should not be used for issues that have been
through Wholistic\'s existing grievance or complaints procedure but is
intended to cover major concerns. These include:

-   Conduct which is an offence, or a breach of law.
-   Disclosures related to miscarriages of justice.
-   Health and safety risks.
-   Damage to the environment.
-   The unauthorised use of Wholistic\'s funds.
-   Possible fraud and corruption.
-   Sexual or physical abuse of an employee, foster carer or child.
-   Serious failure to comply with appropriate professional standards.
-   Abuse of power and authority for any unauthorised use or personal
    gain.
-   Deliberate breach of Wholistic\'s policies.

Wholistic encourages employees, foster carers and children to put their
name to any allegations through its whistle blowing policy whenever
possible, however, anonymous allegations will also be considered.
Employees, foster carers and children may wish to consider discussing
their concern with a colleague first and may find it easier to raise the
matter if there are two or more people who have the same concerns.

Concerns may be raised verbally or in writing, and the earlier a concern
is expressed, the easier it is to take action. Although employees,
foster carers and children are not expected to prove beyond doubt the
truth of an allegation, they will need to demonstrate to the person
contacted that there are reasonable grounds for concern.

Those who wish to make a written report should try to use the following
format:

-   The background and history of the concern, including relevant dates.
-   The reason why you are particularly concerned about the situation.
-   The extent to which you have personally witnessed or experienced the
    problem.
-   Provision of documented evidence where possible.

Within ten working days of a concern being raised, the Whistle Blowing
Officer responsible for whistle blowing will write to you acknowledging
that the concern has been received and where applicable, will supply you
with information on staff support mechanisms. Some concerns may be
resolved by an agreed action without the need for investigation. If
urgent action is required then this will be taken before any
investigation is conducted.

In order to protect all individuals concerned, initial enquiries will be
made to decide whether an investigation is appropriate and what form it
should take. Concerns and allegations that fall within the reach of
existing specific procedures will be considered under those procedures,
for example, child protection or discrimination procedures. Where
appropriate, the matters raised may:

-   Be investigated by directors or through the agency\'s disciplinary
    process.
-   Be investigated by an internal or external auditor.
-   Be referred to the police.
-   Form the subject of an independent inquiry.
-   Be referred to the appropriate commission.

Employees, foster carers and children may invite their trade union,
Fostering Network representative or a friend to be present during any
meetings or interviews in connection with the concerns you have raised.
Meetings can be arranged at a mutually agreed location.

The amount of contact between employees, foster carers and children
raising a concern and the Whistle Blowing Officer will depend on the
nature of the concerns, the potential difficulties involved and the
clarity of the information provided. If necessary, the Whistle Blowing
Officer may seek further information from you and subject to any legal
constraints, the employees, foster carers and children will be kept
informed of the progress of enquiries.

Wholistic ensures that any difficulties the employees, foster carers and
children may experience as a result of raising a concern are kept to a
minimum. For example, if you are required to give evidence in criminal
or disciplinary proceedings, Wholistic will arrange for employees,
foster carers and children to receive legal advice about the procedures.

Wholistic accepts that employees, foster carers and children need to be
confident that the concerns raised have been properly addressed. Subject
to any legal constraints, Wholistic will inform you of the outcome of
any investigation.

Wholistic\'s whistle blowing policy is intended to enable employees,
foster carers and children to raise concerns. If employees, foster
carers and children are not happy with the outcome of any investigation
and want to take the matter outside Wholistic, the following are
possible contact points:

-   The Fostering Network.
-   The appropriate commission.
-   The police.

If employees, foster carers and children do take the matter outside
Wholistic they should ensure that confidential information is not
disclosed.

### - Child Protection

Wholistic Fostering is committed to promoting and safeguarding the
welfare of children. Any matter that comes to the attention of carers,
staff, volunteers and Panel members and is of a child protection nature
will be reported to the relevant authorities under the Child Protection
Referrals Procedure.

Where a member of staff, volunteer, Panel member or foster carer
considers that a child protection matter has arisen within the agency
and has not been dealt with appropriately, s/he may make use of this
procedure and report matters of concern to the senior manager within the
agency or a report can be made to the local authority (for the area
where the child is placed or the relevant person lives) or to the
Regulatory Authority.
