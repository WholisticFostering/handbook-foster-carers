title: 🏡 Staying Put Policy
---


## 🎯 Aim

To support young people to remain living with their foster carers after
turning 18, giving them a more stable and supported transition to
adulthood.

## 📚 Legal Framework

**Children Act 1989** **Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011**
**Planning Transition to Adulthood for Care Leavers (2010)** **National
Minimum Standards (NMS 12.4)**

Staying Put arrangements allow young people to remain in their foster
home past 18, helping them develop life skills before moving on.
Independent fostering agencies must have a Staying Put policy and ensure
foster carers are prepared for this option.

## ✅ Who Can Stay Put?

Young people may benefit if they:

-   Are still in education after turning 18
-   Have additional needs (e.g. learning disability)
-   Need more time to prepare for independence
-   Would be at risk in other settings

We believe all young people leaving care deserve the option to remain
with their carers where appropriate, to avoid rushed transitions and
poor outcomes.

## 📝 Our Approach

Wholistic Fostering:

-   Encourages carers to consider Staying Put **before** pathway
    planning begins
-   Discusses Staying Put during supervision to avoid late decisions
-   Supports early planning to reduce anxiety for young people

## 💷 Financial & Legal Arrangements

-   Staying Put may affect carers\' **tax**, **benefits**, and
    **availability for new placements**
-   Carers are supported to understand these implications in advance
-   If the young person meets their **Local Authority's criteria**, WF
    will help negotiate support and funding
-   Some Staying Put arrangements may be **private agreements** between
    the carer and the Local Authority

## 🎓 Education and Staying Put

If a young person is in education beyond age 18, we will request the
Local Authority maintain the Staying Put arrangement **until their
course ends**, to protect their chances of success.

## 🧰 Ongoing Support

Wholistic Fostering will continue to offer:

-   Guidance via the **young people's website** (independence tools,
    life skills, etc.)
-   Ongoing support to carers, including training
-   Support with DBS checks for young people still living in the foster
    home (if other children are placed)

Carers remain responsible for helping the young person:

-   Build independence
-   Learn essential life skills
-   Engage with transition planning

## 🧾 Summary

Staying Put is about:

-   **Choice** -- young people should not have to leave their home when
    they turn 18
-   **Stability** -- continuing relationships where safe and positive
-   **Support** -- helping young people move on in their own time
