title: Staying Put

## Aim

To provide young people with an opportunity to remain living with their
foster carers beyond the age of 18 years under a staying put
arrangement.

## Underpinning Regulations and Standards

\<WRAP center round info 60%\> The Planning Transition to Adulthood for
Care Leavers Regulations and Guidance 2010 and the Fostering Regulations
and Guidance 2011 (Children Act 1989) both require local authorities to
have a Staying Put policy.

The Fostering Services National Minimum Standards (standard 12.4)
requires independent fostering providers to have a policy and practical
arrangements which enable children to remain with their foster carer(s)
into legal adulthood, for example so that s/he may develop appropriate
life skills before being required to move to more independent
accommodation.

The statutory guidance also states:

*'For young people with a stable foster placement, continuing to live in
their former foster home under a "Staying Put" arrangement can offer a
transition to independence closer to that experienced by most other
young people. Local authorities should develop Staying Put policies that
provide foster carers and young people with information and guidance
regarding all aspects of continuing living arrangements beyond the young
person's 18th birthday, including criteria for continuing these
arrangements beyond 18 and financial and support arrangements. Such
arrangements are not covered by the 2011 Regulations but fostering
services should have a policy covering Staying Put arrangements and the
assessment process for foster carers should prepare them for the
possibility of continuing to provide support to young people beyond the
age of 18.'*

## Suitability for Staying Put arrangements

Young people are most likely to benefit from a Staying Put arrangement
if they:

-   Are continuing a course of education beyond their 18th birthday
-   Are not ready for supported accommodation at 18 years, often due to
    a learning difficulty
-   Require specialist provision that is not yet available
-   Are at risk of harm or exploitation

However, Wholistic Fostering believe that all care leavers can benefit
from an opportunity to remain with their former foster carers which
enables them to experience a transition like that of their peers and
avoid the negative outcomes associated with leaving care such as social
exclusion and tenancy breakdown.

## Policy

Wholistic Fostering encourages foster carers to consider whether they
are able to offer Staying Put arrangements for young people before the
Pathway Planning process begins. Decision making at this stage avoids
uncertainty for the young person during the Pathway Planning process,
particularly when the young person's wish is to remain in placement, and
enables alternative accommodation options to be explored as early as
possible.

Staying Put has implications for foster carers in terms of payments, tax
liabilities and availability for continued fostering and Wholistic
Fostering encourages foster carers to explore these implications as
early as possible and discuss their ability to offer this opportunity to
young people with their supervising social worker before the Pathway
Planning process begins.

When foster carers are able to offer Staying Put arrangements, and when
the young person wishes to remain living with their foster carer after
the age of 18 years, and when the young person meets their Local
Authority's criteria for Staying Put arrangements, Wholistic Fostering
will negotiate fees with the Local Authority based on the young person's
continued support needs. Alternatively, the Staying Put arrangements can
be made as a private arrangement between the foster carer and Local
Authority.

When a young person's course of education extends beyond their 18th
birthday, Wholistic Fostering will request that the Local Authority
continues the placement on a Staying Put arrangement until the end of
the course in order to safeguard the young person's educational
attainment and future life chances.

Wholistic Fostering will continue to offer support and guidance to young
people under Staying Put arrangements, principally through the young
peoples website ( where we will provide age-appropriate resources and
advice for young people developing independent living skills ). Foster
carers will be expected to continue to assist the young person in
developing their independence skills during the Staying Put arrangement
and attend recommended training as necessary (see Transition to
Adulthood and Leaving Care Policy).

Young people remaining with their former Foster Carers under a Staying
Put arrangement will require a DBS check if the Foster Carer is
continuing to offer foster placements. Wholistic Fostering will arrange
this DBS check.
