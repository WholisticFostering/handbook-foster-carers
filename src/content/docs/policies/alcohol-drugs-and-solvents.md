## 🎯 Purpose

To safeguard children and support carers in managing any risks relating to alcohol, drugs, and other harmful substances.

This policy aligns with National Minimum Standard 6 – Promoting Health and Wellbeing.

## 📚 Guidance & Prevention

Wholistic Fostering will make sure children and carers have access to up-to-date, age-appropriate guidance on the risks of:

- Alcohol  
- Drugs  
- Smoking and vaping  
- Solvents and household substances  

If a child is at risk of misusing substances, this must be reflected in their **Placement Plan** with clear strategies for support and reduction.

## 🛑 Obtaining Harmful Substances

If a child is suspected of buying or obtaining harmful substances:

- Carers must inform their Supervising Social Worker immediately.
- The agency will liaise with the child’s social worker to agree on the next steps.

## 🍺 Alcohol Use

### Children and Young People:

Children must not consume alcohol unless:

- Written permission is provided by their social worker.
- It is for a special occasion (e.g., Christmas lunch).

If a child appears to be under the influence:

- Offer water or squash.
- Monitor their condition closely.
- Contact a GP or go to A&E if needed.
- Never ignore the situation.

### Foster Carers:

Carers and visitors should avoid drinking alcohol in front of children except occasionally and in moderation.

After children are asleep or out of the home, carers may drink—but someone must always be fit to respond in an emergency.

Be mindful of the **next day impact** on mood, driving, or your ability to care.
