Wholistic Fostering\'s policy is to ensure we take a child's religious
persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background into
account when making decisions affecting a child placed or to be placed
with foster carers.

We work to help our Foster carers to be informed, trained and confident
about dealing with issues relating to gender, religion, ethnic origin,
cultural background, linguistic background, nationality, disability or
sexual orientation, and be able to involve external professional advice
and support as necessary.

We promoting care which helps develop a child or young person\'s
positive identity, potential and valuing diversity through
individualised care. We firmly believe that children having a positive
self view and knowledge and understanding of their background is a key
component of their ability to achieve positive outcomes in their lives.
