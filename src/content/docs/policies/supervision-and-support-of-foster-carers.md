title: Supervision, Support of Foster Carers
---


## - Scope

This chapter applies to all approved foster carers and explains the way
in which WHOLISTIC FOSTERING provides supervision and support to foster
carers so that they can be equipped to meet the needs of children in
foster placements.

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 21 Supervision and Support to
Foster Carers.

## - Introduction

All approved foster carers will have an allocated, suitably qualified
Supervising Social Worker. The allocated Supervising Social Worker is
responsible for supervising and supporting carers, ensuring that they
have the necessary guidance, support and direction to maintain a quality
service, including safe caring practices. This will include an
understanding that they must work within the National Minimum Standards
for Fostering and the agency\'s policies, procedures and guidance.

NB It is the social worker for the child or children in the foster
placement who holds responsibility for specific advice or support in
relation to the child and his or her Care Plan and Placement
Agreement/Placement Plan.

The Supervising Social Worker must also ensure that the foster carers\'
training and development needs are identified, and that newly approved
carers work towards meeting the Children\'s Workforce Development
Standards and gaining the CWDC Certificate of successful completion.
They also have the responsibility to ensure foster carers are familiar
and made aware of new policies and guidance.

## - Planned Supervision Visits

A programme of supervision visits should be set up and agreed between
the foster carer and the Supervising Social Worker from the time of the
foster carer's approval, and endorsed by the Fostering Service Manager.

Supervision is essentially a supportive and enabling two way process to:

      * Enable foster carers to contribute effectively to the plans for the children for whom they are caring
      * Provide appropriate monitoring and feedback on the foster carers’ work to ensure National Minimum Standards and standards are fully met
      * Complete personal development plans for each carer, which are linked to their training and their annual review.
      * Support foster carers by providing advice or making this available from elsewhere as appropriate
      * Give foster carers an opportunity to raise any problems and make sure they are addressed appropriately
      * Acknowledge the challenges and demands that the fostering tasks make on foster families and ensure appropriate support is available
      * Recognise and address any difficulties the foster carers’ own children may be experiencing arising from fostering
      * Assist foster carers to work in an anti-discriminatory way that respects and promotes individual differences

The agenda for each meeting should cover:

1.  Matters arising from the last supervision
2.  Personal issues, e.g. effect of a placement on the foster carer's
    own family
3.  Child/ren in placement -- their health, cultural, educational,
    leisure and contact needs -- and any support needs
4.  Training/development issues for the foster carers and family
5.  Safe caring and health and safety issues
6.  Foster carer's recording which is to be reviewed by the Supervising
    Social Worker who should sign the foster carers\' diary

The supervision visits should be recorded on a Foster Carer Supervision
Record, signed by the foster carer the Supervising Social Worker, and
Fostering Manager, it should include:

      * Any concerns expressed
      * Any support needs expressed by the foster carers and how they will be met
      * Any financial issues

A record of all meetings will be kept on the foster carers\' file and
one copy will be given to the foster carers.

The supervision records will inform the Foster Carer's review -- see
Review of Foster Carers Procedure.

## - Frequency of Supervision and other Contacts

Supervision meetings will take place at least once every month.

Additional visits may be made for the purposes of support (to the foster
carer or any member of the foster family) and there will be weekly
telephone contact.

For Fostering Families without placements WHOLISTIC FOSTERING will
undertake 8 weekly visits and monthly phone calls.

Foster carers will be provided with information about what support will
be available from the agency outside office hours, including the
relevant contact details.

## - Unannounced Visits

Unannounced visits will take place at least once a year. The main
purpose of the unannounced visit will be to look at the home environment
that a child is living in.

The unannounced visits will be undertaken by the foster carers\'
Supervising Social Worker or the Fostering Support Worker who will need
to check:

      * Who is in the home
      * Who is looking after the child
      * If the carer is not at home, what arrangements have been made for the care of the child

If the foster carers are not at home, the Supervising Social Worker or
Fostering Support Worker should leave a note for the foster carers to
say that s/he has visited.

If the foster carers are not at home but the child is present and being
looked after by someone else, the supervising Social worker or Fostering
Support Worker should check the identity of that person but should not
continue with the visit.

Unannounced visits should be recorded on this form
<http://eforms.wholisticfostering.co.uk/uncategorized/unannounced-visit-form/>

There should not ordinarily be a regular programme of unannounced visits
without particular reason -- for example if a foster carer is being
closely monitored. In such an event the reason for such will be
explained to the foster carer.

## - Support Provided by the Supervising Social Worker

    support is required.

    this includes training specifically on issues affecting disabled
    children.
10. Discuss financial issues with the carer: allowances, pocket money,
    leisure activities, toiletries and travelling etc. and the
    importance of complying with the terms of the Council\'s insurance
    policy for carers
