title: Confidentiality
---


## - Scope

This chapter is compliant with the Fostering Services National Minimum
Standards and Regulations 2011, Standard 26 Records.

## - Handling confidential information

WF assumes any information that identifies individuals personally and is
not already in the public domain is to be treated as confidential
information and the data protection laws will therefore apply.

WF staff and carers handling of information must ensure that:

      * It is only shared with individuals authorised to have access to it – see Section 2, When it may be appropriate to share confidential information
      * They promote, support and protect the privacy, dignity and rights of children and young people
      * They comply with best practice
      * They conform with the law

Each member of staff, foster carer, volunteer or independent worker will
be expected to sign a confidentiality statement, a copy of which will be
retained in their file.

## - When it may be appropriate to share confidential information

It is generally only appropriate to share confidential information with
others if informed consent has been given to its disclosure by the
person to whom it relates.

In some situations, however, WF will be required by law to share
information, for example, when a court makes an order for certain
information or case files to be brought before the court. These
situations are relatively unusual.

However, there may be situations which arise when working with children
and families where the sharing of confidential information without
consent is appropriate. These are described in the paragraphs below.

Sharing information amongst those working with children and their
families is essential. In many cases it is only when information from a
range of sources is put together that a child can be seen to be at risk
of Significant Harm. Where there are concerns that a child may be at
risk of Significant Harm, it is essential that staff members and carers
within WF understand when they can share confidential information
lawfully for this purpose.

The key factors in deciding whether or not to share confidential
information are necessity and proportionality, i.e. whether the proposed
sharing is likely to make an effective contribution to preventing the
risk and whether the public interest in sharing information overrides
the interest in maintaining confidentiality.

It is not possible to give guidance to cover every circumstance in which
sharing of confidential information without consent will be justified.
It is possible however to identify some circumstances in which sharing
confidential information without consent will normally be justified in
the public interest. These are:

      * When there is evidence that the child is suffering or is at risk of suffering Significant Harm; or
      * Where there is reasonable cause to believe that a child may be suffering or at risk of Significant Harm; or
      * To prevent Significant Harm arising to children or serious harm to adults, including through the prevention, detection and prosecution of serious crime, i.e. any crime which causes or is likely to cause Significant Harm to a child or serious harm to an adult.

Where there is a clear risk of Significant Harm to a child, the public
interest test will almost certainly be satisfied.

## - Breaches of Confidentiality

Confidence is breached where the sharing of confidential information is
not authorised by the person who provided it or, if about another
person, by the person to whom it relates or where there was no
justification for sharing the information as set out in Section 2 above.

To minimise \'accidental\' breaches of confidentiality, confidential
information must only be shared with others within WF for genuine
purposes and on a need to know basis. Confidential information should
not be shared with members of foster carers' families who live outside
the household.

No person working within the agency shall knowingly misuse any
information or allow other to do so.

Breaches of confidentiality will be regarded seriously and may result in
action being taken for example a review of approval for foster carers,
disciplinary action for staff.
