title: 🔐 Confidentiality Policy
---


## 📘 Scope

This policy supports Standard 26 of the Fostering Services National
Minimum Standards and Regulations 2011: **Records**. It applies to all
foster carers, staff, volunteers and professionals working with
Wholistic Fostering (WF).

## 🔏 What Is Confidential Information?

Confidential information is any personal data about individuals that is
not already public. All such information must be protected and handled
in line with UK data protection laws.

## 🤝 Our Commitment

WF is committed to safeguarding private information. Everyone working
with us must:

-   Share information only with those authorised
-   Protect the dignity and rights of children and families
-   Follow legal and best practice standards
-   Sign a confidentiality agreement (stored in their personnel file)

## 🔄 When Sharing May Be Necessary

Information can usually only be shared with **informed consent**.
However, **confidential information may be shared without consent** in
these situations:

-   A child is suffering or at risk of significant harm
-   An adult is at risk of serious harm
-   It\'s necessary to prevent serious crime
-   A court order demands disclosure

Before sharing, consider:

-   ⚖️ **Necessity** -- Is sharing essential to protect someone?
-   ⚖️ **Proportionality** -- Does the need to protect override the need
    to keep it private?

Information should only be shared on a **need-to-know basis**, and only
with professionals involved in the child's care and safety.

## ⚠️ Breaches of Confidentiality

A breach happens when:

-   Information is shared without consent or justification
-   Data is accessed or shared by someone not authorised

Confidentiality breaches may result in:

-   📌 Review of carer approval
-   📌 Disciplinary action for staff
-   📌 Termination of volunteer roles

Carers must not share confidential information with family or friends
outside the fostering household.
