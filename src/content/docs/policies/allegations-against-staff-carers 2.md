title: 👥 Allegations Against Staff and Foster Parents
---


## 🧭 Scope

This policy applies to any allegation or concern that a foster carer,
staff member, or volunteer has:

-   Harmed a child or placed them at risk of harm
-   Possibly committed a crime against or involving a child
-   Behaved in a way that suggests they are not suitable to work with
    children

Complaints not involving allegations of harm are dealt with through our:

-   [Complaints Procedure](/policies/core/complaints-representations)
-   [Child Protection Policy](/policies/core/child_protection) (for
    concerns involving others outside the agency)

This policy complies with \*Working Together to Safeguard Children\* and
the \*Fostering Services National Minimum Standards\* (2011).

## 🎯 Policy Statement

All children have a right to safety, and we take all concerns seriously.
If an allegation is made, we act quickly, fairly, and with transparency
--- supporting the child, the person making the allegation, and the
individual who is subject of the concern.

Allegations may be investigated under child protection procedures, and
actions like suspension or deregistration may still occur even without
criminal charges.

## 📘 Key Principles

-   Carers and staff are trained in safe care and understand the
    importance of clear record keeping.
-   Allegations are dealt with in line with Local Safeguarding Children
    Partnership (LSCP) procedures.
-   The Designated Person for Wholistic Fostering is the Registered
    Manager, Patricia Nettleford.
-   The Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) is involved in all
    formal allegations.

## 🚦 What Triggers a Formal Response?

An allegation must be reported immediately if a person:

-   May have harmed a child
-   May have committed a related crime
-   May be unsuitable to work with children

If the allegation involves senior staff or agency owners and the
referrer is concerned it won't be addressed fairly, they can contact the
local authority or Ofsted directly.

## 🔁 What Happens Next?

### 1️⃣ Immediate Actions

-   Notify the Designated Person and LADO
-   Notify child's social worker and supervising social worker
-   Notify placing local authority
-   Consider suspension if risk to children is suspected
-   Inform Ofsted

### 2️⃣ Strategy Meeting

This meeting decides:

-   Whether a child protection (Section 47) or police investigation is
    needed
-   Whether other children need safeguarding
-   Whether the carer or staff member should stop working temporarily
-   Support needs for all involved
-   If a referral to the DBS (barred list) is needed

The meeting will include the LADO, fostering agency staff, police, and
children's services.

### 3️⃣ Investigation

Investigations will be:

-   Timely and well-documented
-   Shared with the foster carer or staff member
-   Sensitive to everyone's wellbeing

Foster carers may need to pause new placements. They will receive
appropriate support, advice, and continued payments during this time.

### 4️⃣ Outcome & Follow-up

A final strategy meeting will:

-   Confirm outcomes
-   Decide next steps (e.g. panel recommendation, deregistration, return
    to fostering)
-   Determine if a referral to the DBS is needed

All outcomes will be recorded and shared with relevant parties,
including the child and their family where appropriate.

A review will take place after closure to support those involved and
reflect on learning.

## 🗃️ Records & Confidentiality

-   All allegation records will be kept on both the staff/foster carer's
    and the child's file
-   A summary must include the nature of the allegation, how it was
    handled, and the outcome
-   Records are kept for at least 10 years or until the person's
    retirement age, whichever is longer
