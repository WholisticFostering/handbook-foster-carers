## Underpinning legislation

National Minimum Standard 18 requires that, for a fostering agency:

\<WRAP center round info 60%\> 'The registered provider has a written
development plan, reviewed annually, for the future of the service,
either identifying any planned changes in the operation or resources of
the service, or confirming the continuation of the service's current
operation and resource.' This is also good practice for a local
authority fostering service. \</WRAP\>

We maintain a basic development plan. The latest version can be found in
the management folder on our cloud system
